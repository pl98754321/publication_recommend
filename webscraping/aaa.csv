However, this master narrative may be challenged be examining the history of decolonization of a small religious minority in Congo-Brazzaville, the Matsouanists. This article will revisit the process of decolonization in Congo as experienced by the Matsouanists. It is a perspective from the margins through which a different reality of decolonization in Congo can be seen - one of violence and exclusion. This piece will argue that Matsouanist representations of decolonization give historical validation to their feelings of victimhood and social exclusion. The research therefore engages with the broader, and urgent, problem of the politics of remembering and forgetting in Congo, and the impact thereof on social division in present-day Congo.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",71,2018

Relative clauses, which function as a kind of noun phrase post-modifier, are among those structures that are believed to contribute to the complexity of academic prose. These grammatical structures can pose difficulties for EFL writers even at higher levels of proficiency, and it is therefore important to determine the frequency and accuracy with which relative clauses are used by L2 learners since understanding learners' strengths and weaknesses in using these structures can inform teachers on ways to improve the process of their instruction in the writing classroom. This paper reports on a corpus-based comparison of relative clauses in a number of argumentative essays written by native and non-native speakers of English. To this end, 30 argumentative essays were randomly selected from the Persian sub-corpus of the ICLE and the essays were analyzed with respect to the relative clauses found in them. The results were then compared to a comparable corpus of essays by native speakers. Different dimensions regarding the structure of relative clauses were investigated. The type of relative clause (restrictive/non-restrictive), the relativizer (adverbial/pronoun), the gap (subject/nonsubject), and head nouns (both animate and non-animate) in our two sets of data were manually identified and coded. The findings revealed that the non-native writers tended to use a greater number of relative clauses compared to their native-speaker counterparts.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",29,2018

Its objective is to identify their similarities and differences from the functional and linguistic points of view. The research consists of several stages. First, the two genres of discourse in question are defined. Then, an overview of their functions is provided. Next, the linguistic means of performing them are analyzed. The results of the research indicate that, due to their main goals, the genres in question express certain functions, which can be verbally expressed in various ways: in Trump's victory speech the inspirative function comes to the fore, while in his inaugural address the integrative and the performative functions dominate the other ones. Furthermore, in each case linguistic peculiarities correlate with the functions: in the victory speech the focus is on the 'greatness' of everything and everyone, whereas in the inaugural speech words connected with patriotism prevail, which is expressed mostly by means of personal pronouns. The results of the current research may function as a basis for further analysis of the genre of the victory speech, as it has not received enough scholarly attention yet, and of the peculiarities of Donald Trump's political discourse.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",29,2018

A number of scientists have found support for the importance of learner autonomy but there is little empirical research on using different strategies for promoting and evaluating students' autonomy. Accordingly, in order to become better language learners, students should plan, implement, and evaluate their own learning. This study aims at fostering and evaluating students' autonomy by scaffolding their speaking practices through role plays in an English for Special Purposes (ESP) course. The research suggests that role-play strategies should help students develop their autonomy in acquiring ESP speaking skills. The study argues that developing autonomy is an efficient way to improve students' performance in ESP speaking skills as it provides them with relevant scaffolding. This article provides theoretical grounding for autonomy. The entry-level and post-study speaking scores (IELTS test) are compared across experimental and control groups. A class-based training course of ESP speaking was offered in an institutional setting to 38 (15 male, 23 female) second-year students at a national research university in Russia. A special questionnaire was developed to assess learner autonomy in ESP speaking, which proved that role play promoted learner autonomy and encouraged students to master ESP speaking skills. The results of the study indicate that students who were developing their speaking skills via role play performed significantly better than their peers in the control group. The level of their English language competence improved. The role plays in the ESP speaking course proved to be a viable and productive teaching strategy for fostering autonomy among students.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",31,2018

These are the questions which this paper tries to answer. For this purpose, a study with Turkish kindergarten children from Berlin, Germany was conducted. A total of 40 children were divided into two groups between 3 and 6 years old and tested twice in a year with the TEDIL Test1. The test consists of pictures and measures the knowledge of Turkish nouns, verbs, adjectives, prepositions, and syntax. All of the children were tested individually by a native Turkish speaker and by the researcher. The testing was done in the kindergarten setting. The results showed that the knowledge of both age groups on different grammatical categories in Turkish was equal on the first test and there were no statistical differences. However, during the second test the group of older children showed a decrease in their knowledge of the grammatical categories in their mother tongue. This paper discusses the factors that influenced the regression in the knowledge of Turkish. This study is one of only a few on bilingual Turkish children and it presents new information about mother tongue loss among kindergarten children, discusses the reasons, and suggests that kindergartens and families should cooperate and work together in order to prevent mother tongue loss from a very early age as well as its effect on the cognitive development of bilingual children.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",24,2018

By employing a qualitative ethnographic approach, an open-ended questionnaire was conducted with finalyear information technology students and structured and unstructured interviews with the HR managers and the alumni respectively. In this study, the communicative needs of the finalyear technical students were specifically addressed to provide them with career education and placement training and raise employment opportunities in their course of study. Based on the results of the questionnaire-based survey and subsequent observations in the structured and unstructured interviews, it is widely examined that all of the HR managers reflected on the importance of English language in corporate communications. The findings of the survey also reflected that the perceptions of the alumni and the expectations of the HR managers on verbal and nonverbal skills were well received by the final-year technical students. This is a positive development on the part of students as they were found to be thoroughly aware of their workplace needs and were keen to develop language, communication, and soft skills for successfully entering into the job market. This research implies that connecting institution and industry is a significant factor in helping students obtain job offers and develop the job-specific skills that meet the requirements of the industry.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",47,2018

Observation, a questionnaire, and pre-and post-tests were employed as data gathering instruments. The research was designed through a time series quasi-experimental research design. The data were analysed through repeated measure ANOVA, independent t-tests, as well as descriptive statistics. The findings indicated that there was a statistical difference between the experimental and the control groups. Hence, students who participated in mastery learning instruction improved their writing skills and achieved better scores in writing skills assessment. Particularly, learners who learned through mastery learning instruction were able to develop paragraphs and essays with clear topic sentences and thesis statements. They also developed paragraphs with proper punctuation and minimized various mechanical errors that were observed during the pre-test. Furthermore, the students who engaged in mastery learning instruction had better levels of motivation. Thus, individualized instruction and continuous feedback helped them improve their engagement in writing activities. Hence, this study calls for more attention to self-paced instruction, regular feedback, assessment, and continuous support in writing classrooms.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",54,2018

The LAs in this program consisted of Japanese study abroad students, that is English as a second language students, coming to study from Japanese universities for either one semester or one academic year, as well as American learners returning from a one-year academic study abroad program in Japan. In the southeastern region of the United States, the Japanese language is not yet considered a major foreign language, thus few opportunities exist for American learners to connect with native speakers of Japanese. The LA program endeavors to ease this limitation. It has been extremely beneficial for our American learners to have opportunities to communicate regularly with Japanese study abroad students in the classrooms. Furthermore, it was found tremendously valuable for Japanese study abroad students and greatly helpful for the instructors as well. This paper describes the procedures and examines the effectiveness of introducing an LA program into Japanese language classes. To analyze the program, questionnaires were distributed to LAs (N=20); five department instructors wrote comments concerning the program; and five Japanese language learners submitted reflection papers.

Despite this apparent agreement, government reform of the US public school system has proven contentious and challenging for both political parties. New data from a diversity of sources allow us to examine the more contentious aspects of school-funding policy and offer insight as to why education-funding reform has been difficult. We find that from 1998 to 2016, citizens were remarkably consistent in their opinions on general questions of school funding. However, there has been substantial disagreement and change in the public opinion toward national versus local school funding, tying teacher salaries to student performance, and specific methods of increasing school choice. This macro-level stability and consistency and micro-level instability and inconsistency may help explain why implementing reform remains difficult even though the desire for reform is widespread.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",13,2018

To analyze the state of the art of using meta-Analyses in survey methodology, previous meta-Analyses are systematically identified and classified according to the thematic areas the analyses address. This is followed by identifying gaps in research (i.e., areas where there are few or no existing meta-Analyses) and investigating potential avenues for future meta-Analyses in this field. The findings are based on a systematic search of two bibliographic harvesters (together covering 265 bibliographic databases), which yielded 54 eligible manuscripts reporting 60 meta-Analytic studies and 91 effect sizes. To identify the thematic areas, the effect sizes are structured according to seven categories of the total survey error (TSE). Characteristics of primary studies that potentially influence the variability of meta-Analytic findings also are considered, such as the survey mode, questionnaire design, and sample characteristics. The results show that the thematic areas of these meta-Analyses cover only two of the seven TSE categories: measurement and nonresponse error. Thematic areas in the remaining TSE categories are not covered, and the key practical implication is that gaps exist in current research. Regarding the methodology of existing meta-Analyses in the survey methodology field, there are fundamental differences in reporting styles in terms of transparency and replicability, calling for a concerted effort to develop meta-Analytic reporting standards for survey methodology.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",38,2018

Assuming the public agenda's capacity to be relatively fixed, scholars have argued that increasing agenda diversity must exert upward pressure on volatility, generating issue competition. This study reveals that the public agenda has continued to diversify, but volatility has changed little; indeed, the agenda was less volatile in 2014 than it had been in decades. Moreover, issue-carrying capacity has grown, raising questions about the traditionally posited limits of the public agenda's issue-carrying capacity. Issue-carrying capacity is positively related to agenda diversity and negatively related to volatility.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",41,2018

Guided by feelings-As-information theory (FIT;Schwarz 2011), the first study presents an experiment (N = 1,018) in which the language difficulty of public opinion questions was varied. Findings suggest that language difficulty affected metacognitive experiences, which in turn affected reports of political interest, political efficacy, don't know responding, and ideological constraint. Study 2 (N = 1,817) presents cross-sectional evidence from publicly available data that also indicates question-language difficulty influences don't know responding. Given these findings, study 3 (N = 8,090) presents a content analysis that reveals significant systematic variability in language difficulty within polling questions across 10 polling firms in 2016. Contextualizing these findings within a FIT framework, we contend that variability in language difficulty differentially and systematically affects participants' metacognitive experiences while responding to public opinion questions. Given that metacognitive experiences affect survey response, language difficulty ought to be more carefully considered when drafting opinion questions. To this end, the data presented in these studies can be used to aid question construction by providing numeric guidelines, using widely available measures that contextualize the relative difficulty of survey language. It is also recommended that items assessing metacognitive experiences be included in survey research to account for variance in this measure. At a time when polling data are ubiquitous yet polling accuracy is being called into question, it is critical to identify sources of unmeasured error within polling data.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",48,2018

Evidence from Administrative Data,Public Opinion Quarterly,"[('U.S. Census Bureau', 'Washington, D.C.', 'United States')]","© Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Association for Public Opinion Research 2018.Many surveys ask respondents to consult financial records in order to improve data accuracy. However, the assumption that record use reduces measurement error has not been tested with a large-scale comparison to administrative data. This paper compares interest, dividend, and rental income in the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to administrative IRS 1040 tax data. In a novel estimation strategy, we use various measures of respondent motivation and precision to account for nonrandom selection. Our results show that record use is associated with reducing the discrepancy between survey and administrative data by approximately 21 to 43 percent. In terms of potential costs from encouraging record use, record users spend an extra 3.5 seconds for each asset question, on average, after controlling for their behavior in other parts of the SIPP interview. The extra time per question translates to a 2.2 percent increase in the total duration of the interview. Thus, while record use may be an effective tool for improving data accuracy, it may come at the cost of higher interviewer compensation and increased respondent burden.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",19,2018

This study investigates whether partisans from different parties react the same to changes in policy (as implied by the parallel-publics literature), or differently (as implied by the partisanship literature). I argue that we should see important differences in policy feedback between partisan groups, but only on salient policies that have large disagreement across partisan lines. To test this expectation, I use the thermostatic model of opinion-policy feedback, relying on data from the 1973-2014 General Social Survey. Findings indicate that partisans react differently to policy in issue areas with relatively large disagreement. This finding enhances our understanding of the interaction between partisan control of government and partisanship in the opinion-policy process.

All rights reserved.The purpose of this study is to investigate the stability of natural teeth whitening by analyzing the change on the tooth enamel surface and major mineral components, as well as tooth whitening using a natural material, such as fruit juice. Only the buccal surfaces of 20 premolar teeth extracted were assigned to 5 groups (n=4). For Group 1, normal saline was applied; for Group 2, strawberry and baking soda were mixed at a ratio of 3:1; for Group 3, lemon and baking soda were mixed at a ratio of 3:1; and for Group 4, baking soda and water were mixed at a ratio of 3:1. About 1 ml of each material was applied on the enamel surface using a toothbrush. For Group 5, 5 mm whitening toothpaste was applied using a toothbrush. Color changes using the CIELAB, pH measurement using a pH meter, surface morphology using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and mineral content using electromagnetic wave (X-ray) photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) were measured. The whitening effect was highest in the teeth applied with lemon compared to the whitening toothpaste. The pH value was lowest with the lemon application, which showed a distinctly rough surface and porosity. The Ca and P values were lowest in the tooth surface whitened with lemon. It was confirmed that tooth whitening with natural fruit juice increased the roughness of the tooth surface due to the acidic low pH. It also caused enamel demineraliza-tion and posed harm to the teeth.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",22,2018

The novel fragmented magnetic equivalent circuit method (MEC) is developed to accurately capture inherited nonlinear characteristics of 4-pole hybrid electromagnet to investigate force characteristics and magnetic field distribution. To confirm this method, two possible scenarios, which are levitation under plain core and levitation under dual-linear motor are composed. As well as, they are examined by both proposed method and FEM analyses. Comparative analyses of both methods revealed that force, inclination torque, and mutual interference can be easily captured with adequate accuracy while at the same time yielding less computation and set up time. Furthermore, the fragmented formulations of permeance functions can be generalized for the analysis and the design of similar devices which specifically involve inclination motions.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",26,2018

To study the degree of medical radiation exposure, we measured and analyzed the lead apron’s shielding rate on direct radiation dose according to the quality of radiation beam. The distribution of space dispersal dose at X-ray exam was also measured at X-ray test on chest (100 kVp, 4 mAs, 100 mA) and L-spine AP (76 kVp, 200 mA, 32 mAs) to find out a better method to shield the worker’s radiation exposure. To measure the quality of X-ray in the scope of voltage generally used for X-ray exam in the hospital, half-value layer was estimated at the voltages which is ranged from 40 to 120 kVp. Effective energy was estimated at the same voltage range and the result was 12.5 keV~39.9 keV. The result of measuring radiation dose at increasing the voltage by 10 kVp each time on the range of 40~120 kVp, showed that the shielding rate of 0.50 mm Pb lead apron is superior to that of 0.25 mm Pb lead apron for all ranges of voltage. The difference of shielding rate between 0.50 mm Pb and 0.25 mm Pb lead apron increased as the voltage increased. The maximum difference was 10.2 % at 120 kVp.

The operability of a reed switch application has been proved to be affected by the electromagnetic field generated around the application or an adjacent reed switch itself.

All rights reserved.Magnetically controlled reactor (MCR) can compensate the capacitive reactive power generated by transmission line and enhance the stability of power supply, which is widely used in ultrahigh-voltage (UHV) power systems. In this paper, a novel structure for MCR with multi-taps is proposed. The MCR with multi-taps can switch its taps based on operation condition. The higher tap ratio is used to adjust the reactive power, and the lower tap ratio is fit for the stable grid. A switching algorithm is designed to make it work harmoniously and flexibly. For the adjustment of reactive power, this novel structure can perform better in regulated time without using higher tap ratios in practical operation, compared with the traditional structures.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",11,2018

All rights reserved.Delivery Quality Assurance (DQA) is performed to evaluate the intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). However, differences in the DQA results may be caused by factors such as the IMRT technique, treatment volume, etc. In this study, we compared five types of gamma index and four types of dose differences as IMRT technique, Treatment site, Volume of Planning Target Volume (PTV), Regularity Shape Index (RSI), indices of treatment planning evaluation. From January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017, 32 patients who underwent IMRT plan were used to perform Step and Shoot (SNS) technique, Sliding Window (SW) technique, and Volumetric Modulated Arc radio-Therapy (VMAT) technique. After obtaining the Treatment Site, Volume of PTV, RSI, CI, HI, QOC according to each planning technique, nine factors of DQA were compared. As a result of the comparison, it was not possible to confirm the tendency of the items except the IMRT technique. The results of the IMRT technique showed the highest values for area gamma (< 1.0) and area dose difference (> 0.8) for SNS technique, and the lowest values for the other seven factors. For VMAT technique, the lowest value was obtained for area gamma (< 1.0) and area dose difference (> 0.8), and the highest value was obtained for the other seven factors. This study is limited to Electronic Portal Image Device(EPID). Therefore, it is necessary to study various equipment and program version in order to evaluate various DQA tools. In addition, there are limitations on the Treatment Site, Volume of PTV, and etc. necessary for evaluation. Therefore, it is considered that evaluation using various cases will be needed in the future. Nine factors, results of DQA, were a tendency by the IMRT techniques. The tolerance range of gamma index should be tightly in 80 % and 60 %, and the tolerance range of dose difference index should be tightly in 75 % and 25 %. Therefore, it can be concluded that accurate electromagnetic radiation therapy can be performed by applying the appropriate tolerance according to the IMRT technique in the future.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",24,2018

All rights reserved.Recently, studies on magnetic gears have been actively conducted. Magnetic gears can replace mechanical gears as they can perform noncontact power transfer, thereby minimizing loss and damage from friction. A magnetic gear has two rotors with different numbers of poles because of its structural characteristics. For a rotor with a relatively lower number of poles, large torque ripples occur owing to the increase in the permeance variation within the air gaps. Other electric equipment studies conducted thus far have primarily changed the shape of iron core to reduce torque ripples. However, since the magnetic gear has two air gaps, it is necessary to identify the relationship between the two gaps and the ripple before changing the shape of the iron core. In this paper, factors that affect torque ripple are classified and analyzed by examining the magnetic flux density of two air gaps, to propose an air gap structure that benefits the design of magnetic gears.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': 'December 2018', 'day': '31'}",10,2018

Magnetic torque is controlled by the three-axis Helmholtz coil with a rotating magnetic field, and magnetic force is controlled by generating gradient magnetic field through the separated coils by the switch control. Three switches separate each Helmholtz coil and six switches control the separated six coil with the three power supplies.

All rights reserved.In this paper, we study the fault detection algorithm and the fault compensation method in case of hall sensor fault of BLDC motor. In the case of a BLDC motor operating at high speed, the fault of the hall sensor is a very important factor that reduces the reliability of the control. If hall sensor fault occurs, ripple occurs in torque and current output value of BLDC motor. In addition, a phenomenon such as rapid braking of the motor may occur. Therefore, this paper assumes the fault of one or two hall sensors, and studies hall sensor fault detection algorithm and hall sensor fault compensation method. The peak-to-peak interval of the hall sensor signal is stored and the peak-to-peak interval is checked in real time to detect the fault immediately after the hall sensor fault. Unlike existing algorithms, it has higher reliability than existing fault detection algorithms, because it detects faults in real time. When a fault is detected, a signal of a normally operating hall sensor is input to the hall sensor fault compensation circuit. The output of the compensation circuit is a signal whose phase is delayed. The phase difference of each hall sensor signals is 120°. Therefore, the gain of the compensation circuit is appropriately selected to generate a signal for compensating for the fault of the hall sensor.

All Rights Reserved.Exposure to light is very important for human health. However, the characteristics of the light stimulus and the appropriate timing of such exposure are essential. Studies that have used monochromatic light exposure have shown no systematic patterns for the effects of blue light compared to longer wavelengths. Previous studies have shown that red light exposure increases objective and subjective measures of alertness at night without suppressing nocturnal melatonin or inducing circadian disruption. The present study investigated whether noon time exposure to red light would increase both objective and subjective measures of alertness such as those measured by EEG, cognitive-behavioral performance, and subjective sleepiness. The three lighting conditions were as follows: dim light (< 0.01 lux at cornea), blue light (465 nm, 72 μW/cm2), and red light (625 nm, 18 μW/cm2), both at 40 lux. The results of the EEG data showed an increase in theta power over time in dim light only. In red light, alpha power showed a decrease over time. The impact of red light was observed in the performance measures: The only significant effect was a deterioration in the continuous performance test after red light exposure. Subjective measures of alertness were not affected by light in either condition, in contrast to darkness, when subjects reported greater sleepiness than before. None of the changes in objective measures of alertness induced by red light exposure translated into subjective sleepiness at noon. Thus, we concluded that behavioral effects of light at noon are very limited at best.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",75,2018

Addressing this situation, the richness of lycophytes and ferns in 11 semi-deciduous forest remnants, located in the northwestern region of Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, is presented. In total, four species of lycophytes (two families and two genera) and 88 species of ferns (15 families and 44 genera) were recorded. The most diverse families were Pteridaceae and Polypodiaceae, with 18 and 17 species respectively; Asplenium (10 spp.) was the most diverse genus. Among the recorded species, only Dicksonia sellowiana is cited in the Brazilian List of Threatened Plant Species. Most of the surveyed species have a broad distribution, occurring in South America (44.6%) and Tropical America (32.6%). The surveyed remnants showed intermediate species richness in relation to other areas previously studied in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, except for Parque Estadual do Turvo, where 81 species were recorded. The floristic similarity analysis shows that the Parque Estadual do Turvo is the most dissimilar area, presenting a high number (28) of exclusive species. The observed high value of the cophenetic correlation coefficient (0.968), indicate a small distortion between the similarity matrix and multidimensional space shown in the dendrogram.

As a relatively unknown alternative in this context we investigate an approach by the philosopher Rudolf Steiner. It comprises a first-person method, along with the theoretical background of what has come to be known as the mirror metaphor – an analogy for the brain as a necessary but not a sufficient basis for mental activity.

On the other hand, both cueing and priming experimental studies have shown that providing phonological information may help resolve a recall failure, whereas providing structural or semantic information is usually not helpful. A possible explanation of this discrepancy between the spontaneous use of semantic/contextual information and the experimentally demonstrated uselessness of this kind of information is provided. Finally, the role of syntactical similarity (belonging or not to the same part of speech) in the efficiency of phonological priming is discussed.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",40,2018

All rights reserved. The objective was to study the effects of primary growth vs. regrowth grass silage on intake, growth and carcass traits of growing bulls. In a feeding experiment, 30 bulls were offered a total mixed ration ad libitum. Two dietary treatments included either first or second cut grass silage (550 g kg -1 dry matter) supplemented with rolled barley (435 g kg -1 dry matter) and a mineral-vitamin mixture (15 g kg -1 dry matter). Feed and energy intake as well as the live weight gain of the bulls decreased when the second cut silage was used instead of the first cut silage. No differences in carcass conformation or carcass fat score between the treatments were observed. Analysed chemical, digestibility or fermentation parameters of the silage samples did not explain the differences in feed intake. However, some second cut silage samples were found to contain mycotoxins (zearalenone, roquefortine C, mycophenolic acid and HT-2), but it is difficult to estimate whether this was the factor that affected feed intake in the present study.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",49,2018

Weight loss and cooking loss were smaller, and drip loss was greater after frozen storage compared with refrigerated storage. The pH of stored meat was typical of high-quality beef. TBARS values increased after refrigerated storage and after frozen storage. The changes in color parameters point to metmyoglobin formation in frozen meat. Both refrigerator and freezer storage had beneficial influence on tenderness, and shear force values decreased in frozen beef. The composition of MA during refrigerated storage had no effect on the analyzed parameters of beef. Frozen meat that was stored in a MA containing Ar prior to freezing was characterized by the lowest weight loss, and vacuum-packaged meat-by the lowest TBARS values.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",79,2018

Optimization of acidic chloride bath containing triethanolamine and citric acid for deposition of a smooth and uniform Zn-Ni alloy coating over mild steel is discussed in the present work. Bath constituents and operating parameters were optimized by standard Hull cell method. Triethanolamine and citric acid were used as additives altered the phase content in the coatings, most likely as a result of their adsorption at the surface of the cathode. The effect of citric acid was more pronounced than that of triethanolamine. The composition of coatings was determined by using colorimetric method. The bath followed anomalous codeposition with preferential deposition of Zn over nobler metal Ni. The experimental results reveal that a bright Zn-Ni alloy coating having ~4.92 wt.%Ni was showing peak performance of the coating against corrosion. Deposition was carried out under different condition of current densities and molar ratio of [Ni +2 ]/[Zn +2 ]. No transition current densities at which codeposition behaviour changed from anomalous to normal type was observed. The cathode current efficiency was higher than 80%. As the current density was increased or the bath temperature was decreased, the concentration of the nobler metal in the coating was increased. The thickness and hardness of all coatings increased as the applied current density was increased. The throwing power and reflectance of the coating was increased with current density to a peak value, and then decreased. Potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods were used to assess the corrosion resistance of Zn-Ni alloy coatings at different current densities. Surface morphology of the coatings was examined using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). A new and cheap Chloride bath, for bright Zn–Ni alloy coating on mild steel has been proposed, and results are discussed.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",16,2018

Umarani, published by Sciendo.Shear connectors are designed in steel-concrete composite construction to transmit the longitudinal shear, to prevent separation of steel and concrete slabs, and also to increase the structural efficiency of the whole system. In this study, the performances of different types of shear connectors in steel-concrete composite specimens are evaluated by conducting push-out tests under monotonic loading conditions. An ISMB 200 @ 25.4 kg/m universal steel beam measuring 400 mm and a reinforced cement concrete slab measuring 300 mm with a breadth of 200 mm and a thickness of 200 mm reinforced with 8 mm diameter steel rods are used for the experimental study. The results reveal that the load-slip relationships for various types of shear connectors and failure mechanisms are obtained to identify those shear connectors which are more relevant to the steel-concrete composite members.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",12,2018

Then, one-way ANOVA was applied to analyze the variations of each variable among different age groups over varying time periods. The statistical analysis revealed that driving duration had a significant effect on the variation of visual behaviors and feelings of fatigue. After 2h of driving, only the average closure duration value and subjective level of fatigue had an increase of one-fifth or more. After 4h of driving, however, all these variables had a significant change except for the number of saccades and pupil diameter measurements. Particularly, driver saccadic eye movement was more sensitive to driving fatigue, and the elderly were more likely to be affected by the duration of the drive. Finally, a predictor of driver fatigue was determined to detect the real-time level of fatigue and alert at the critical moment.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",15,2018

Methods Fifty eight critical illness patients and 21 healthy controls were included in the study. Of the included 58 critical illness patients, 37 cases were diagnosed of sepsis (sepsis group) and other 21 were non-sepsis subjects (non-sepsis group). Of the 37 sepsis patients, 17 were diagnosed of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS group). The serum level of neopterin of the above subjects were examined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and compared between groups. Results The serum level of neopterin were 0.885±0.34(ng/mL), 3.77±2.08(ng/mL), 14.80±6.78(ng/mL) and 23.90±11.26(ng/mL) for healthy control, non-sepsis, non-MODS and MODS groups respectively with significant statistical difference (F=52.71, p<0.001). Serum neopterin level of non-sepsis, non-MODS and MODS groups were statistical different in the time points of 0, 24h, 48h, 72h, and 96h (p<0.05). The serum neopterin level was significant higher in MODS group compared to nonsepsis and non-MODS groups (p<0.05). Using the serum neopterin as biomarker in differentiation of MODS from sepsis, the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity and AUC were 70.59% (95%CI:44.04-89.69) %, 80.00% (95%CI:56.34-94.27)% and 0.74(95%CI:0.57-0.91)% respectively.

The static mechanical performance of plasticized and unplasticized epoxy resin was evaluated. The test results showed that the DBP modified epoxy resin can obtain a higher toughness than conventional epoxy resin, but the elastic modulus and the tensile strength were slightly reduced. The low cycle fatigue test results indicated that the stress ratio and the stress level were two critical factors of fatigue life, which was increased with the growth of stress ratio. It was also found that the fatigue life of plasticized specimen was much less than that of the unplasticized specimen because of the plastic deformation. A logarithmic linear relationship was then established to predict the fatigue life for plasticized epoxy resin. The strain energy density was also applied to demonstrate the accumulation of energy loss. In addition, the fatigue toughness can be obtained by the hysteresis loop area method.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",15,2018

Sivakumar, et al., published by Sciendo.The construction industry in India is the country's second largest industrial sector, after agriculture. The construction industry makes a remarkable contribution to the Indian economy and provides employment to a large number of people of India. Fire is a chemical reaction of a combustible substance with oxygen, involving heat and is usually accompanied by a visual flame or incandescence. Ensuring fire safety has always been a challenge to the stakeholders, i.e. building owners, construction companies, contractors and sub-contractors, and government employees due to the multiplicity of the factors involved and their complexity. There are various legal standards and requirements for ensuring fire safety on construction sites. The buildings are normally provided with firewalls during construction and these firewalls separate two structures or divide a structure into smaller portions to prevent the spread of fire. The lightweight construction and trusses are designed to support only their own weight. During a fire, if one fails, a domino effect happens and all fail rapidly within 5 to 10 minutes. Prolonged exposure to fire may result in structural collapse and injury or death of the occupants of the building under construction. Fire safety on construction sites is still in its primitive stages in India. There is a great necessity to improve fire safety on construction sites to protect construction workers and other occupants of the buildings. This study aims to design and implement fire safety systems for construction sites, thereby enhancing the standards to meet the system requirements at par with global standards.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",11,2018

The growth of this industry has been rapid for the last 25 years, however, aquaculture still relies heavily on feed input from wild capture fisheries. Landings in wild capture fisheries have been stagnant for the last two decades; therefore, new alternatives for conventional fish meal and fish oil need to be found. In this review, various alternatives are described and their advantages and disadvantages are evaluated. Single cell oils (SCO) and single cell proteins (SCP) produced by microorganisms are recognized as the alternative with the most potential for replacing fish meal and fish oil in aquacultures. However, production costs of SCOs and SCPs are still higher than production costs of Omega-3 rich oils from other sources (wild capture, plant derived oils and genetically modified plants); therefore, currently used substrates need to be replaced with cheaper agriculture and industrial biomass residues applicable for microbial fermentation. In order to evaluate various biodegradable residues and find the most suitable ones for SCO and SCP production, methods analysing resource availability are reviewed.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",76,2018

Methods Seventy-six severe burn patients with burns covering a total body surface area (TBSA) above 70% were included in this study. Of the 76 patients, 29 cases developed MODS (MODS group) and the remaining 47 subjects did not (non-MODS group). From the MODS group, 12 patients died (Death group) and 17 patients survived (Survive group). The serum level of neopterin in the MODS and non-MODS groups were examined by radioimmunoassay on following 1, 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 and 28 post-burn days (PBDs). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyse the predictive value of serum neopterin for MODS and death. Results The serum neopterin level in the MODS group was significantly higher than that of non-MODS group between 3~28 PBDs (p<0.001). However, the serum neopterin levels between the MODS and non-MODS groups following 1 PBD were not statistically significant (p>0.05). The best diagnostic performance of serum neopterin for MODS occurred 14 PBDs with the prediction sensitivity and specificity of 75.86% (56.46%~89.70%) and 85.11% (71.69%~93.80%) respectively. However, serum neopterin levels had no clinical value in predicting the death of MODS patients. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.72 (0.58~0.85), 0.81 (0.71~0.92) and 0.83 (0.72~0.94) for serum neopterin as biomarker in the prediction of MODS after 3, 7 and 14 PBDs, respectively. The AUCs were 0.50 (0.27~0.73), 0.53 (0.30~0.76) and 0.56 (0.33~0.79) for serum neopterin as biomarker in prediction of death for MODS patients after 3, 7 and 14 PBDs, respectively. Conclusion The persistent and significant increase of serum neopterin level is closely related to the development of MODS in patients with severe burns. Serum neopterin is therefore a promising serological marker for MODS early diagnosis, but has little efficacy in the prediction of the likelihood of death in severe burn patients with MODS.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",23,2018

Al Musawi, published by Sciendo.Reinforced concrete is one of the most widely used structural components about which much scientific research has been conducted; however, some of its characteristics still require further research. The main focus of this study is the effect of direct fire on the shear transfer strength of concrete. It was investigated under several parameters including concrete strength, number of stirrup legs (the steel area across the shear plane), and fire duration. The experimental program involved the testing of two sets (groups) of specimens (12 specimens each) with different concrete strengths. Each set contained specimens of two or four stirrup legs exposed to direct fire from one side (the fire was in an open area to simulate a real-life event) for a duration of one, two, and three hours. The results of the comparison showed the importance of using high-performance concrete (instead of increasing the number of stirrup legs) to resist shear stress for the purpose of safety. A significant reduction in shear strength occurred due to the deterioration of the concrete cover after three hours of direct fire exposure.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",18,2018

This research estimates the current and forecasts the future changes of farm size and labor occupational mobility over time and across the region. A panel dataset, which is used in this study, was collected in the three different years (1988, 2000 and 2008) from 62 villages across 57 districts. Stationary Markov chain approach was used in this analysis to estimate structural change. The results of this study imply that the agricultural sector is dominated by small farms in past, present and also in the future. The forecasting predicts that the numbers of marginal, medium and large farms are going to decrease in future. Moreover, it indicates that the average farm size of small landholders will slightly increase as the numbers of marginal and large landowners reduces. The analyses of the transition probabilities of labor occupational change show that rural households are gradually shifting to non-farm activities and mostly part-time farming from other income generating activities over time. In general, the forecast also suggests narrowing of agricultural activities and expansion of part-time farming and non-farm activities in future.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",17,2018

Both diseases are characterized by chronic inflammation of unclear etiology. The inflammatory bowel diseases incidence is continuously observed to rise. Colon inflammatory response is a physiological process which occurrence is indispensable as an organisms' defense reaction. The inflammation may be caused by internal factors associated with body's cells as well as external factors, such as infections and exposition for inflammatory agents. Until recently, IBD have been classified as autoimmune diseases, today they seem to be associated with gut barrier disorders or dysbiosis. Factors that predispose to inflammatory bowel diseases include: Genetic factors, dysbiosis and so called western-type diet, natural components such as gluten and lactose. In addition, the development of the disease is favored by: Cigarette smoking, phosphate, nanomolecules, sodium chloride, emulgents, carrageenan, carboxymethylcellulose, pollution, maltodextrin. IBD affects whole the body, causing serious medical consequences. Symptoms like anxiety and chronic stress, that occur commonly, can lead to depressive disorders. Quantitative and qualitative dietary deficiency caused by absorption disorders, may promote the occurrence of osteoporosis and osteopenia. In addition, dysbiosis coexisting with alterations in intestinal permeability can lead to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. IBD medical consequences include also systemic complications, associated with the extra gastrointestinal manifestations' occurrence.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",73,2018

In order to bridge this gap in literature, we conducted a TFP decomposition exercise using dairy farm summary records from the New York state which is one of the historically major milk producing regions of the United States. Stochastic frontier models with air temperature, incorporated as an environmental input in an otherwise conventional dairy production function, are estimated using an unbalanced panel of constructed 'average' dairy farms of various size-classes covering a sufficiently long time-period. Change in TFP is then decomposed into various components namely technological change, technical efficiency change, and scale efficiency change. Further analysis also establishes that the introduction of average air temperature in the stochastic production frontier soaks what otherwise could be attributed to inefficiency and/or model residual.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",27,2018

Simultaneously, beef farming contributes significant environmental impacts. To support farmers, actors from the whole value chain are now promoting Swedish beef as particularly ‘sustainable’. The paper draws on critical discourse analysis of interviews with and documents from the largest Swedish supermarket chain ICA, Swedish farmer organisations and farmers to study how ICA and farmers articulate sustainability and their responsibility for the same. Articulations are subsequently discussed in the light of actual environmental impacts of beef production and the distribution of power in the beef value chain. The findings suggest that negative environmental impacts and farmers’ struggles are largely hidden in the dominant articulation of sustainability. Furthermore, ICA does not use the power it has to steer consumers toward reduced beef consumption. We conclude with suggesting more open deliberation about current levels of beef sales and consumption and about what compromises to make when striving for ‘sustainable’ beef consumption.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",63,2018

In this study, proteomic approach was employed to study the response of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from individuals residing in HLNRA (N = 10; mean radiation dose: 15.60 ± 3.04 mGy/y) vis-à-vis responses in individuals from adjoining normal-level natural background radiation areas (NLNRA; N = 10; mean radiation dose: ≤1.50 mGy/y) using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry. A total of 15 proteins were found to be statistically altered in individuals from HLNRA when compared to individuals from NLNRA (P ≤ 0.05). Most of the changes in expression were small. The mean coefficient of variation for the differentially altered proteins was found to be ∼34%. Pathway enrichment analysis with Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery distinguished 44 biological processes significantly (P ≤ 0.05) modulated in HLNRA samples. More importantly, when challenged with an ex vivo dose of 2 Gy, HLNRA PBMCs responded with an up-regulation of many protective pro-survival proteins such as protein disulfide-isomerase A1 (PDIA1), peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) and glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78). PDIA1 and PRDX6 are known to play an important role in redox homeostasis. GRP78 is considered the master regulator of unfolded protein response that aims to restore endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and thus, regulate cell survival. Principal component analysis identified clear clusters based on radiation dose. The expression changes of key proteins were validated by western blotting using additional samples from HLNRA and NLNRA. This indicates that the human cells respond to low dose of ionising radiation through dynamic changes in the proteome to maintain adaptive homeostasis. These findings emphasise that the dose-response relationship at low doses of radiation may not be linear and, thus, provide mechanistic challenge to the linear-no-threshold hypothesis.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",29,2018

However, its conventional detection for in vivo samples relies on immunological methods using anti-γH2AX antibodies, making quantitative analysis difficult. Here, we established an absolute γH2AX quantification in vivo method for multiple organs in mice using liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. When applying the method to male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice (8 weeks old), the testes showed the highest γH2AX level (2.3% of total H2AX), followed by the bone marrow (0.51%), stomach (0.28%), kidney (0.20%), spleen (0.20%), liver (0.15%) and lung, which had the lowest overall level (0.10%). After intraperitoneal administration of 2 mg/kg mitomycin C in mice, γH2AX levels increased until 2-4 h, followed by a monotonical decrease to the control level in the bone marrow and spleen, and increased moderately until 24 h, followed by a slight decrease by 48 h in the liver, stomach, lung and kidney. After oral administration of 400 mg/kg ethyl methanesulphonate, γH2AX levels increased until 8 h and then decreased to the control level by 24-48 h in the spleen and kidney, increased until 24 h and then slightly decreased until 48 h in the bone marrow and lung, increased until 8 h and plateaued by 48 h in the liver, and decreased until 8 h and then increased to the control level in the stomach. Both the genotoxic chemicals did not alter γH2AX levels in the testes. These results indicate that our novel method could reveal variation in the γH2AX state in mouse organs and allows monitoring of the in vivo dynamics induced by genotoxic chemicals.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",49,2018

It has been studied in a number of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity assays and is considered an unusual nucleoside analogue owing to its potent mutagenic potential, with little to no measurable clastogenic activity. Given this atypical profile, CEDU represented an interesting compound for evaluating the in vivo Pig-a gene mutation assay, a test that is undergoing extensive validation for regulatory safety applications. The current report describes two studies with 7-week-old male Wistar Han rats, one that exposed animals to several dose levels of CEDU for 5 consecutive days, the other for 28 consecutive days. Blood samples were collected at several time points and analysed for Pig-a mutant cell frequencies via flow cytometry. These Pig-a analyses were accompanied by micronucleated reticulocyte (MN-RET) measurements performed with blood samples collected 1 day after cessation of treatment. Both studies showed robust CEDU dose-related increases in Pig-a mutant reticulocytes and mutant erythrocytes. Conversely, neither experiment showed evidence of a CEDU-related MN-RET-inducing effect. These rat haematopoietic cell results were in good agreement with those of earlier mouse studies where in vivo mutagenesis was observed, without clastogenicity/aneuploidy. Taken together, these data add further support to the concept that the Pig-a assay represents an important complement to the widely used in vivo micronucleus assay, as it expands the range of important DNA lesions that can be detected in short-term as well as protracted exposure study designs.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",22,2018

WWOX is a tumor suppressor gene that has been associated with several types of cancer such as hepatic, breast, lung, prostate, gastric, and ovarian. Recently WWOX has been implicated in epilepsy, where studies show homozygous loss-of-function mutation lead to early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy, spinocerebellar ataxia, intractable seizures and developmental delay, and early lethal microcephaly syndrome with epilepsy. Here we investigate two consanguineous Saudi families and we identified three probands with epileptic encephalopathy. Whole exome sequencing revealed a novel homozygous mutation in the WWOX gene in one proband. In addition, we identified a previously reported WWOX mutation in two probands. Later on these findings were confirmed with Sanger sequencing. The underlying mechanism on how WWOX mutations lead to seizure remains elusive. To date very few WWOX mutations have been associated with neurological disorder and our newly identified mutations support the notion that WWOX play an important role in neurons and will aid in better diagnosis and genetic counseling.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",31,2018

Among these modifications, phosphorylation plays an important role in modulating the functional properties of proteins. Plants perceive environmental cues that directly affect the phosphorylation status of many target proteins. To determine the effect of environmentally induced phosphorylation in plants, in vivo methods must be developed. Various in vitro methods are available but, unlike in animals, there is no optimized methodology for detecting protein phosphorylation in planta. Therefore, in this study, a robust, and easy to handle Phos-Tag Mobility Shift Assay (PTMSA) is developed for the in vivo detection of protein phosphorylation in plants by empirical optimization of methods previously developed for animals. Initially, the detection of the phosphorylation status of target proteins using protocols directly adapted from animals failed. Therefore, we optimized the steps in the protocol, from protein migration to the transfer of proteins to PVDF membrane. Supplementing the electrophoresis running buffer with 5 mM NaHSO3 solved most of the problems in protein migration and transfer. The optimization of a fast and robust protocol that efficiently detects the phosphorylation status of plant proteins was successful. This protocol will be a valuable tool for plant scientists interested in the study of protein phosphorylation.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",27,2018

Owing to the seasonal and long-term agricultural cultivation methods of Korean ginseng, they are always vulnerable to various environmental stress conditions. ABSCISIC ACID (ABA) is an essential plant hormone associated with seed development and diverse abiotic stress responses including drought, cold and salinity stress. By modulating ABA responses, plants can regulate their immune responses and growth patterns to increase their ability to tolerate stress. With recent advances in genome sequencing technology, we first reported the functional features of genes related to canonical ABA signaling pathway in P. ginseng genome. Based on the protein sequences and functional genomic analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana, the ABA related genes were successfully identified. Our functional genomic characterizations clearly showed that the ABA signaling related genes consisting the ABA receptor proteins (PgPYLs), kinase family (PgSnRKs) and transcription factors (PgABFs, PgABI3s and PgABI5s) were evolutionary conserved in the P. ginseng genome. We confirmed that overexpressing ABA related genes of P. ginseng completely restored the ABA responses and stress tolerance in ABA defective Arabidopsis mutants. Finally, tissue and age specific spatio-temporal expression patterns of the identified ABA-related genes in P. ginseng tissues were also classified using various available RNA sequencing data. This study provides ABA signal transduction related genes and their functional genomic information related to the growth and development of Korean ginseng. Additionally, the results of this study could be useful in the breeding or artificial selection of ginseng which is resistant to various stresses.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",32,2018

In this study, we generated the transgenic potato plants that express the IbMYB1 genes, which accumulated high levels of anthocyanins under the control of either the tuber-specific patatin (PAT) promoter or oxidative stress-inducible peroxidase anionic 2 (SWPA2) promoter. The PAT-MYB1 transgenic lines exhibited higher anthocyanin levels in the tuber than the empty vector control (EV) or SWPA2-MYB1 plants. When combined, our results indicated that overexpression of the IbMYB1 is a highly promising strategy for the generation of transgenic plants with enhanced tissue specific anthocyanin production.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",17,2018

However, it is difficult to distinguish naked oats from covered oats when the husk is removed from the grains by a special process. The present study was carried out to investigate experimental methods that would be beneficial in the segregation of different types of oats after husk removal. Grain quality-related biochemical compounds were analyzed in a bid to differentiate the oat dehulling characteristics. In addition, 61 SSR markers were examined for genetic relationship and variety identification of oats using five naked and seven covered oat varieties. Results showed that, the contents of protein, lipid, and β-glucan were not significantly different among the oat varieties and this could not be used as an index for distinguishing oats husk character. However, in the fatty acid composition ratio,, naked oats had a higher ratio of stearic acid (C18:0) and oleic acid (C18:1) than covered oats, and covered oats had a higher ratio of linoleic acid (C18:2) and linoleic acid (C18:3) than naked oats. The assessment of SSR marker genotype revealed that 33 polymorphic bands among 12 oat varieties and 1 variety could be distinguished through the combination of polymorphic markers thus indicating the usability of these markers for variety identification in oats.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",15,2018

Treatment with Pro (10 mM) resulted in more accumulation of Pro (~2.6-fold) in Pro-treated spinaches compared to untreated ones. These Pro-pretreated spinaches were more freezing-tolerant, showing more turgid leaves and petioles compared to untreated controls. However, when spinaches pre-treated with or without Pro were subjected to freezing, there was no significant difference in overall amino acid contents, emphasizing the role of Pro as an osmo-protectant. Freezing stress prompted intensification of total amino acid contents irrespective of pretreatment with Pro. Asp, Glu, Ala, and Val were the most abundant free amino acids due to increased protein degradation and nitrogen mobilization for plant survival under freezing stress. Arg, a precursor for the synthesis of polyamines in plants, was profoundly enhanced under freezing stress. This implies that Arg plays an important role in modulating freezing tolerance. Gly, Leu, and Ile were maintained at relatively low levels in all treatments.

Historically, social security benefits were reduced if labor income exceeded a certain level. The employment tax ranged from a $1 reduction for each $1 earned to a $1 reduction for each $3 earned. Prior to 2000, the age at which this reduction was no longer applied, varied between 70 and 75. However, in 2000 the age was lowered to what the Social Security Administration calls the normal retirement age which ranges between 65 and 67 depending on the date the person was born. Such a major change provided fertile ground for economic research. Studies have proliferated on the impact of the regime change on the labor force participation rates of elderly males. However, little work has been conducted regarding the impact of this policy change on female labor force participation rates. This study shows that after the employment tax was eliminated for those reaching their normal retirement age, the labor-force participation rates of single, divorced, separated and widowed women in the targeted age range usually increased. The estimates indicate the labor-force participation rates of married women in the affected age range fell with the elimination of the employment tax.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",17,2018

How many realities are dealing with AAI? What professionals and animals are involved? The results of the questionnaire here reported have the objective to answer these questions, outlining a snapshot of the distribution and the main features of AAI within Italian territory. According to the 208 respondents, the sector has seen a remarkable expansion over the last twenty years. AAI providers are located mainly in the North and Centre of the country, the majority of them are arranged in associations or AAI specialized centers and work mainly with dogs and equids in animal assisted activity (AAA) programs addressed to disabled people and children. The picture of the sector still appears fragmented in particular regarding team of professionals involved and their training; nonetheless, the recent set up of national guidelines by the Italian authorities has the objective of standardizing the field and defining best practices for each type of intervention.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",null,2018

The present study evaluated the extent of egg shedding in 475 horses living in 12 farms from 3 regions of Italy. All examined farms and 224 horses (47.6%) were positive for cyathostomins. 138 horses (28.8%) scored positive for cyathostomin FECs with a range of eggs‑per‑gram of faeces (epg) values of 50‑2,150. Further 86 horses (18.1%) were positive only under qualitative microscopy (i.e. < 50 epg). Of the animals with a FEC > 50 epg, 81 (17%) and 57 (12%) showed values of 50‑200 and > 200 epg, respectively. The findings from this study demonstrated a reduced presence of high‑shedding horses compared to results obtained in previous years in the same study areas, despite overlapping climate features in the previous 5 years. A continuing monitoring of epidemiological and biological features of horse cyathostomin infection is crucial for planning intervention programmes aimed to maintaining animal health and preserving the efficacy of parasiticides.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",null,2018

Published with license by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.Introduction: Percutaneous image-guided cryo- (CA) and radiofrequency- (RFA) ablations have been widely used in the treatment of painful bone metastases (BM). However, paucity of data is available for the performance of these treatments when used with a curative intent. The aim of this study is to investigate the local progression free-survival (LPFS) after radical percutaneous image-guided ablation of BM in oligometastatic patients, and to identify predictive factors associated with local tumor progression. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective review of all patients who underwent percutaneous image-guided CA or RFA of BM with a radical intent between 2007 and 2018. Results: Forty-six patients with a total of forty-nine BM underwent percutaneous image-guided CA (N = 37; 75,5%) or RFA (N = 12; 24,5%). Primary malignancies included thyroid (N = 11, 22.5%), breast (N = 21; 42.9%), lung (N = 8; 16.3%) and other (N = 9; 18,3%) cancers. Additional consolidation was performed after ablation in 20.4% cases (N = 10). Mean follow-up was 34.1 ± 22 months. Local progression at the treated site was observed in 28.5% cases (N = 14); 1- and 2-year LPFS was 76.8% and 71.7%, respectively. Size of BM (>2 cm) predicted local tumor progression (p =.002). Conclusions: Percutaneous image-guided locoregional therapies used in the radical treatment of BM in oligometastatic patients demonstrate significant rates of LPFS providing the size of BM ≤2 cm.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",41,2018

Currently, one of the topical issues of improving GLONASS system is modernization of its uniformity measurement equipment, including RF measurement equipment and electronic length measurement equipment. To this end, at the Spatial Reference Proving Ground of theSiberian State University of Geosystems and Technologies (SSUGT), the authors of this article carried out a successful experiment to measure a short GNSS baseline by receivers equipped with Chip Scale Atomic Clocks (CSACs) with instability of 10 −11 showed that the mean deviation between the slant distance (D) measured using GNSS receivers connected to CSACs and their certified value varied in the range of 0.1–2.5 mm, with the average value of 0.9 mm. The mean deviation obtained using GNSS geodetic receivers not connected to CSAC and their certified value made up 9.4 mm. The obtained experimental results suggest that substitution of quartz frequency generators with temperature compensation used in geodetic GNSS receivers for Chip Scale Atomic Clocks in any metrological or verification kit increases accuracy and reliability of short baselines measurements results, which highly perspective in view of development of techniques for creating reference baselines with a reproduction error of unit length of about 1 mm per 1 km.

It began in October 2015 and ended in October 2018. Initiated by the Lund University and partners from the Middle East countries, the GeoNetC project is an ambitious project aiming to match labour market needs with geospatial education offer both in Europe and Middle East countries. The aim of this three-year project is to enable European universities to exchange best practices and innovation with each other and with Middle Eastern universities regarding the mismatch between Europe’s geospatial education and training and the geospatial education in Middle East countries. There is a growing need for well-trained students at all levels – vocational, bachelors, masters – in the field of geospatial technologies. Obviously there is a growing number of jobs available in land surveying, mapping data collection, data processing, data delivery and turning data into information in both European and Middle East countries. Through cooperation, all partners will improve the quality of their respective academic programs. The European partners will make their courses more attractive and well adjusted for students from the Middle East. As well, they will increase the general quality and add state-of-the-art learning components to their offerings, and the partners from the region will significantly increase the academic level and quality in the education they provide. There will be spin-offs into other subjects than environment/Geomatics, since both the pedagogic models developed (e.g. e-Learning) and communication and administrative tools can be used throughout the partner universities. Therefore, this partnership cooperation will be of great value to Partner Countries as well as to Programme Countries. A number of distance learning courses/modules are developed jointly by partner institutions in Europe and the Middle East. The main aim of the network is to promote the use of spatial information and earth observation for environmental management and modelling through capacity building and institutional development, via a network in which all partners would contribute from their own positions of strength. All 13 modules are following EU higher education standards regarding e.g. ECTS, and learning outcomes. The outcome of the project, in terms of courses/modules, will be freely used among the partners, with the possibilities of offering individual courses or a whole MSc programme, whether individually or together.

Results of injection test and analysis of wellbore breakouts were used to verify the accuracy of the stress profiles. In this study the Bartoon method, which using the breakout angle and strength of rock, was used. In addition, the ability of artificial neural network to estimate the elastic parameters of rock and stress field was used. The output of the neural network represents a high accuracy in the estimation of the desired parameters. In addition, the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion was used to verify stress profiles. Estimated stresses show relative compliance with the results of injection test and Barton method. The required minimum mud pressure for preventing shear failures was calculated by using the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion and the estimated stress profiles. The results showed a good compliance with failures which have been identified in the caliper and image logs. However, a number of noncompliance is observed in some depth. This is due to the concentration of fractures, collisions between the drill string and the wellbore wall, as well as swab and surge pressures. The stress mode is normal and strike-slip in some depth based on the estimated stress profiles.

Others retort that state officials are not neutral or objective, but have their own interests to advance and protect, and, therefore, cannot be trusted.

All rights reserved.There has been a numerous amount of economic research carried out which has aimed at identifying the factors that could contribute positively to economic growth. The economic literature available on this matter appears to acknowledge that entrepreneurship is one of the elements that could positively contribute to this growth. Among other factors, both entrepreneurship and knowledge are generally considered to play an important role regarding this macro-economic goal. Bearing this in mind, the positive bond that exists between both of them, which also contributes to economic growth and improvements in welfare, is increasingly analyzed in the different economic studies available. The goal of this paper is to empirically analyze the existing relationship between economic growth, knowledge and entrepreneurship within the context of Latin American countries during the period 2001-2016. For this purpose, the self-employment variable has been used as an empirical proxy of entrepreneurship. In general, the availability of reliable statistical information on entrepreneurship is quite limited especially in the case of the Latin American countries. Consequently, this is one of the reasons why there is a lack of unanimity as to the application of one dataset or another to measure entrepreneurship in the analysis. Therefore, although it is true that there is certain disagreement regarding the use of the aforementioned empirical proxy, there are, however, several references in favor of the use of self-employment statistics in the analysis of entrepreneurship. In order to do so, first of all we study the existing link between economic growth and certain determining factors such as public expenditure, investment, human capital, knowledge and entrepreneurship. Afterwards, we analyze the effects on entrepreneurship caused by such factors as, for example, unemployment, taxes and education (as a proxy of knowledge).","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",66,2018

The primary target of this extension is to enhance statistical inference in DEA and to integrate it with a stochastic mechanism of Bayesian techniques. To develop the stochastic DEA model, we use Stan Stochastic Modelling Language within the framework of the R Statistics. Analyzing the results, we can state that the DEA method can be used for analyzing efficiency, and the additions shown can make the evaluation much more accurate.

All rights reserved.The concept of the business model has garnered the attention of business administration researchers and professionals for over 50 years, and especially since the last decade of the 20th century, as a result of the appearance and widespread use of the internet in business. Despite the large number of doctrinal contributions, studies and analyses carried out, these years of research have not resulted in consensus among authors and professionals regarding either a definition or the core elements of a business model. This article provides a proposal for the definition of business model, as well as a proposal for a table of elements which includes those that we believe will be of great importance in the future of organisations, such as their approach to security, the code of ethics and their own capacity for transformation. To create the definition and table of elements, numerous publications regarding the concept of the business model were analysed, mainly from between 1996 and 2017, when the concept was most highly developed in the academic literature. The article suggests future lines of research to study the evolution of the concept of the model, the greater or lesser importance of certain elements, as well as the impact on the bottom line of the transformation of and innovation in the model itself.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",82,2018

All rights reserved.The purpose of this paper is to compare perceptions on drivers of managing multiple European co-funded projects among public and private institutions from Romania, and determine which dimensions of multi-project management optimization have the greatest impact on institutional financial stability and organizational learning. Data were collected using an online questionnaire administrated to two convenience samples of 100 public institutions, and 100 private organizations from Romania, involved in managing multiple European co-funded projects. Multi-project management optimization was measured using two dimensions: the relational dimension for governance of multiple projects and the regulative dimension. Data were analyzed by using confirmatory factor analysis, ANOVA and linear regression. In the private organizations sample, relational dimension was the most important predictor of organizational learning, while regulative dimension was the most important predictor of financial stability in the sample of public institutions.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",22,2018

All rights reserved.In recent years, social movements have echoed calls for greater social and environmental responsibility. Although financial institutions promote development, consumers have lost confidence in banks. As we enter the Fintech era, banks have the opportunity to use new tools that enable greater transparency for customers. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) plays a key role in increasing social awareness of regulators, society, shareholders, and employees—in short, stakeholders. This study therefore focuses on banks that have designed their activities and investments to contribute to sustainability. The principal contribution of this paper is to show the existence of a range of business models that arise following different responses by different types of banks. These different responses occur because the primary objective of sustainable banks is to meet the needs of stakeholders and contribute to sustainable development, whereas conventional banks simply apply and execute CSR policies. It is possible to differentiate between ethical banks and commercial banks. To ensure economic progress and achieve sustainability, it is fundamental to balance economic profitability with people’s social and environmental aspirations.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",84,2018

All Rights Reserved.Objective: Report our experience of the management of a patient with undiagnosed retroperitoneal paraganglioma and the intraoperative complications that the theatre team faced. Case report: We present a case of a 36-year-old patient who during oncological follow-up for a previous diagnosis of parotid acinar cell carcinoma was incidentally identified as having an interaortocaval tumour. Following routine preoperative assessment the patient was arranged to undergo a laparoscopic retroperitoneal tumour resection. After minimal tumour manipulation the patient developed cardiac rhythm abnormalities and became hypertensive. The tumour was successfully removed laparoscopically after a cautious inter- aortocaval dissection. Abruptly, prior to extraction of the tumour containing endobag, the patient developed cardiac arrest. Following 35 minutes of life support measures there was a return of spontaneous circulation. The endobag was laparoscopically removed from the abdominal cavity 24 hours later using the initial operative port sites. The patient´s progression was satisfactory and he could be discharged six days postoperatively. Conclusions: Asymptomatic undiagnosed paragangliomas represent a real challenge during laparoscopic operations. Haemodynamic changes and life-threatening events can arise acutely intraoperatively, where an immediate and coordinated response of the whole theatre team may be required to avoid fatal outcomes.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",3,2018

All Rights Reserved. Objective: A longitudinal prospective case control study was organized to explore the relationships between glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal resistive index (RRI) and blood pressure values in a non-dialysis dependent adult population affected by chronic kidney disease and exposed to low systolic blood pressure (SBP) values. Material and methods: The study sample (54 patients: 31 males and 23 females with an average age of 61.7 ± 19.2 years) was randomly selected from a population of adult non-dialysis dependent patients that scored a SBP < 100 mmHg at the medical examination. The patients were equally divided in two groups defined by the presence and absence of chronic kidney disease, (i.e. a GFR less or greater than 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 , respectively). Patients were submitted to a full therapeutic and dietetic intervention to correct the hypotension until reaching a steady SBP > 100 mmHg. Results: In the group with chronic renal disease, the comparison between the data recorded with SBP < 100 mmHg (t0) and those detected with SBP ≥ 100 mmHg (t1) showed a statistically significant decrease of serum creatinine as well as an increase of GFR (mean serum creatinine t0 – serum creatinine t1: 0.194 ± 0.35, p < 0.01; mean GFR t0 – GFR t1: -4.615 ± 8.8, p < 0.013). There was also a statistically significant reduction of the RRI (mean right kidney RRI t0 – mean right kidney RRI t1: + 0.082 ± 0.03, p < 0; mean left kidney RRI t0 – mean left kidney RRI t1: 0.076 ± 0.03, p < 0). Conclusion: We concluded that, in CKD, when aorta is stiffed, a decrease of SBP can limit the renal perfusion that, in this condition, is mostly dependent by stroke volume, causing an increase of RRI and a decrease of GFR that we suppose as reversible with the restoration of SBP.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",17,2018

All Rights Reserved. Introduction: Chronic prostatitis (CP)/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) represents a challenge for the urologist, since the therapeutic efficacy does not always result in a satisfactory quality of life for the patients. Often the side effects of the medications used (anti-inflammatories, antibiotics, alpha blockers) far outweighs the benefits gained with their admission. The choice of nutraceutical medications is preferred for their effectiveness, that has been accepted and proven by the scientific community, and for the low incidence of side effects. The objective of this study to compare the therapeutic efficacy of the flower pollen extracts (Deprox ® ) versus Bioflavonoids in terms of reduction of symptoms, and in the average waiting time of the variation of the National Institute of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI), and to evaluate the quality of life improvement of the patients affected by CP/CPPS. Methods: Among the 68 patients presented with prostatic symptoms to the Hospital “Umberto I” in Rome, Italy between March 2016 and June 2016, 54 patients met the clinical diagnosis of CP/CPPS (class IIIa or IIIb according to the NIH classification). The patients were assigned to either treatment with Deprox ® or quercetin based on a randomization scheme previously determined.The NIH- CPSI, IPSS, QoL questionnaires were administered. Every patient underwent bacterial cultures and trans-rectal ultrasound. Results: There was a statistically significant improvement of the NIH-CPSI score and QoL in the Deprox ® group (p = < 0.0001 and p = 0.003 respectively). The average waiting time of the variation of the National Institute of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) was statistically significant (p = 0.0019). In the absence of efficacy of the “conventional” medications, which also carries significant side effects, the dietary supplements may represent a valid alternative. Conclusions: DEPROX ® has demonstrated a significant improvement of the symptoms and quality of life of patients diagnosed with by CP/CPPS. Furthermore, there was a statistical difference in the average waiting time of the variation of the NIH-CPSI) score without side effects as compared to the bioflavonoids complex with quercetin.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",24,2018

All Rights Reserved.The modern clinical research on prostatitis started with the work of Stamey and coworkers who developed the basic principles we are still using. They established the segmented culture technique for localizing the infections in the males to the urethra, the bladder, or the prostate and to differentiate the main categories of prostatitis. Such categories with slight modifications are still used according to the NIH classification: acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS) and asymptomatic prostatitis. Prostatic inflammation is considered an important factor in influencing both prostatic growth and progression of symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis. Chronic inflammation/neuroinflammation is a result of a deregulated acute phase response of the innate immune system affecting surrounding neural tissue at molecular, structural and functional levels. Clinical observations suggest that chronic inflammation correlates with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and an history of clinical chronic prostatitis significantly increases the odds for prostate cancer. The NIH-NIDDK classification based on the use of the microbiological 4-glasses localization test or simplified 2-glasses test, is currently accepted worldwide. The UPOINT system identifies groups of clinicians with homogeneous clinical presentation and is used to recognize phenotypes to be submitted to specific treatments. The UPOINTS algorithm implemented the original UPOINT adding to the urinary domains (U), psycho-social (P), organ-specific (O), infection (I), neurological (N), muscle tension and tenderness (T) a further domain related to sexuality (S). In fact sexual dysfunction (erectile, ejaculatory, libido loss) has been described in 46-92% of cases with a high impact on the quality of life of patients with CP/CPPS. Prostatic ultrasound represents the most popular imaging test in the work-up of either acute and chronic prostatitis although no specific hypo-hyper-echoic pattern has been clearly associated with chronic bacterial prostatitis and CPPS. Use of a digital-processing software to calculate the extension of prostatic calcification area at ultrasound demonstrated a higher percentage of prostatic calcification in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis. Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) is the current state-of-the art imaging modality in the assessment of patients with prostate cancer although a variety of benign conditions, including inflammation, may mimic prostate cancer and act as confounding factors in the discrimination between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions. Bacteria can infect prostate gland by: ascending the urethra, reflux of urine into the prostatic ducts, direct inoculation of bacteria through inserted biopsy needles or hematogenous seeding. Enterobacteriaceae are the predominant pathogens in acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis, but an increasing role of Enterococci has been reported. Many strains of these uropathogens exhibit the ability to form biofilm and mul-tidrug-resistance. Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) agents, in particular Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium, have been also considered as causative pathogens of chronic bacterial prostatitis. On the contrary the effective role in genital diseases of other ""genital mycoplasmas"" is still a much debated issue. Sexually Transmitted Infections agents should be investigated by molecular methods in both patient and sexual partner. “Next generation” investigations, such as cytokine analysis, cytological typing of immune cells could help stratifying the immune response. Epigenetic dysregulation of inflammatory factors should be investigated according to systemic and compartment-specific signals. The search for biomarkers should also include evaluation of hormonal pathways, as measurement of estrogen levels in semen. Antimicrobials are the first line agents for the treatment of bacterial prostatitis. The success of antimicrobial treatment depends on the antibacterial activity and the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drug which must reach high concentrations in prostate secretion and prostate tissue. Acute bacterial prostatitis can be a serious infection with a potential risk for urosepsis For iInitial treatment of severely ill patients, intravenous administration of high doses of bactericidal antimicrobials, such as broad-spectrum penicillins, third-generation cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones, is recommended in combination with an aminoglycoside. Use of piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem is justified in presence of multiresistant gram-negative pathogens. The antibiotic treatment of chronic prostatitis is currently based on the use of fluoroquinolones that, given for 2 to 4 weeks, cured about 70% of men with chronic bacterial prostatitis. For the treatment of Chlamydial prostatitis macrolides were shown to be more effective than fluoroquinolones, whereas no differences were observed in microbiological and clinical efficacy between macrolides and tetracyclines for the treatment of infections caused by intracellular pathogens. Aminoglycosides and fosfomycin could be considered as a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of quinolone resistant prostatitis. Use of alpha-blockers in CP/CPPS patients with urinary symptoms and analgesics +/- non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), in presence of pain demonstrated a reduction of symptoms reduction and an improvement of quality of life, although long term use of NSAID is limited by side effect profile. However, the multimodal therapeutic regimen by contemporary use of alpha-blockers, antibiotics and anti-inflammatory showed a better control of prostatitis symptoms than single drug treatment. Novel therapeutic substances for the treatment of pain, such as the cannabinoid anandamide would be highly interesting to test. An alternative for the treatment of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is phytotherapy, as primary therapy or in association with other drugs. Quercetin, pollen extract, extract of Serenoa repens and other mixtures of herbal extracts showed a positive effect on symptoms and quality of life without side effects. The association of CP/CPPS with alterations of intestinal function has been described. Diet has its effects on inflammation by regulation of the composition of intestinal flora and direct action on the intestinal cells (sterile inflammation). Intestinal bacteria (microbiota) interacts with food influencing the metabolic, immune and inflammatory response of the organism. The intestinal microbiota has protective function against pathogenic bacteria, metabolic function by synthesis of vitamins, decomposition of bile acids and production of trophic factors (butyrate), and modulation of the intestinal immune system. The alteration of the microbiota is called “dysbiosis” causing invasive intestinal diseases pathologies (leaky gut syndrome and food intolerances, irritable bowel syndrome or chronic inflammatory bowel diseases) and correlating with numerous systemic diseases including acute and chronic prostatitis. Administration of live probiotics bacteria can be used to regulate the balance if intestinal flora. Sessions of hydrocolontherapy can represent an integration to this therapeutic approach. Finally, microbiological examination of sexual partners can offer supplementary information for treatment.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",117,2018

All Rights Reserved.Objective: Low-intensity shock-wave treatment (LiSWT) is a therapy for erectile dysfunction (ED) with good results reported in the literature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of LiSWT on patients treated for ED and the influence of ED duration in treatment outcomes. Material and methods: We performed an open-label single-arm prospective study of patients treated with LiSWT for ED. Patients were assessed with the IIEF-5 at baseline and at six weeks and three months after LiSWT, and with penile dynamic Doppler ultrasound before treatment and six weeks after. Patients were divided into two groups accordingly to ED evolution time: ≤ 24 months and > 24 months. Results: Twenty-five patients were enrolled, 13 had ED ≤ 24 months and 12 > 24 months. Median baseline IIEF-5 was 14, at 6 weeks post LiSWT was 16 (p < 0.001) and at 3 months post LiSWT was 18 (p < 0.001). Mean baseline peak systolic velocity (PSV) was 29.3 ± 13.0 cm/s, after LiSWT was 35.9 ± 15.2 cm/s (p 0.001). Mean baseline end-diastolic velocity (EDV) was 2.6 ± 4.8 cm/s and after LiSWT was 1.3 ± 4.3 cm/s (p 0.015). No statistical significative difference was identified between the two groups. Conclusions: LiSWT is a safe, harmless and repeatable treatment tool for ED with good outcomes reported. Our results suggest that length of disease duration doesn´t negatively influences treatment results.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2018

All Rights Reserved.Objective:To evaluate the diagnostic value of serum inflammation markers derived from complete blood count in diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 621 patients who underwent prostate biopsy between March 2013 and April 2018. Age, prostate specific antigen (PSA), free PSA, platelet count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, prostate volume (PV) and pathology result of the patients were recorded. Patients were grouped as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatitis and PCa. Patients were also grouped according to PSA values, as PSA < 4, PSA 4-10 and PSA > 10 ng/dl. Results: The mean lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) value of the patients with PCa was significantly lower in the entire cohort (p = 0.047). In the PSA 4-10 ng/dl range, LMR value wassignificantly lower in patients with PCa than those with BPH or prostatitis (p = 0.012). In this PSA range, free/total PSA ratio and LMR were significant factors to predict PCa. The cut-off values of LMR, free/total PSA were 3.05 and 0.15 respectively. The sensitivities, spesificities, positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values using LMR cut-off, free/total PSA cut-off and their combination were assessed. Specificity and PPV of the combination group were higher (97.2%, 83.3% respectively) compared to free/total PSA cut-off group (91.6%, 76.6%) and LMR cut-off group (67.8%, 43.7%). Conclusions: LMR is a useful tool at detecting PCa especially in patients with PSA value between 4 and 10 ng/dl. The combination of free/total PSA ratio and LMR improves the diagnostic accuracy more than the use of free/total PSA ratio alone.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2018

All Rights Reserved.Objective: Retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) is still widely used in clinical practice in localized prostate cancer because of its high oncological success. The aim of this study was to define the continence status in patients where rhabdosphincter was included in the vesicourethral anastomosis. Materials and methods: Between November 2004 and September 2010, 90 cases who underwent RRP by the same surgeon in our clinic were taken into the study. In all cases vesicourethral anastomosis was performed include the rhabdosphincter. The anastomosis was performed with mean 2.9 (0-7) interrupted no 2-0 vicryl sutures, depending on the angu-lation of symphysis pubis and pelvic cavity. Pad test was performed to all patients at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. We defined patients as ‘continent’ when they no need pad, as ‘mild incontinence’ when they use only one pad daily, as ‘moderate incontinence’ when they use two or three pads daily and as ‘severe incontinence’ when they use more than three pads daily. Results: Preoperative total PSA value was 12.2 ng/ml (range: 2.7-84 ng/ml). Preoperative prostate biopsy results were found that Gleason scores were 5, 6, 7 and 8 in 7, 53, 21, 9 patients, respectively. Mean operation and urethral catheter removal time was 103 minutes (60-200) and 14,6 days (9-28), respectively. Mean hospital stay was 4.6 days (2-20). According to results of postoperative pad tests, 38 (42.2%), 48 (53.3%), 55 (61.1%) and 75 (83.3%) patients were defined as continent in first, third, sixth and twelfth months, respectively. Conclusions: We think that, our novel technique of vesicourethral anastomosis in standard RRP provides more optimal urethral position during fixation of pelvic floor and urethra, protect caudal retraction, preserve functional urethral length. Also strong full thickness stitch on urethra provides better urinary continence by hanging urethra in our patients. Although our early continence rate is better, our long term continence rate is similar to literature.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",24,2018

All Rights Reserved.Objectives: We conducted this study to evaluate patients with retained encrusted ureteral stents, identify the predisposing factors and present our experience in the management of such challenging problem. Materials and Methods: This prospective study was carried out in the period from May 2007 to February 2011 at the Urology and Nephrology Center, Al-Thawra General Hospital, Sana’a, Yemen. 40 patients with retained encrusted ureteric stents were treated at our center. All patients were initially evaluated with a radiographic imaging for assessment of stent encrustation and stone burden. Treatment decisions were based on the site and severity of encrustations in the renal pelvis, ureter and bladder and on our technical situation and availability of instrumentations. Multi-modal approaches ranging from extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) to endourological and open urologic procedures were used to achieve stent removal. Results: A total of 90 urological procedures were performed to render all 40 patients stent and stone free. The average duration of stent remained indwelling was 24.2 months (range 4 months -16 years). All patients were managed either by minimally or more invasive multi-modal endourological approaches. For upper coil encrustation percutaneous nephrolithotripsy was performed in eight patients, pyelolithotomy in two patients and ESWL in three patients. Encrustation of the body was treated initially by ESWL, followed by retrograde ureteroscopic manipulation in 12 patients. Lower coil encrustation was successfully managed by cystolitholapaxy in seven patients and one patient required cystolithotomy. Cystolithotomy, pyelolithotomy and ureterolithotomy were carried out in two patients. Two patients who had large burden bladder and kidney stones with loss of kidney function underwent nephrectomy and cystolithotomy. Conclusions: The retrieval of severely encrusted retained ureteral stent and its associated stone burden poses a real management challenge for urologists due to the need for multimodal procedures and the lack of standardized treatment plan.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2018

All Rights Reserved.Penile fractures are generally rare and underreported. The mechanism of injury is due to a rupture of the corpora cavernosa following blunt or sexual trauma to the penis when fully erect. Penile fractures usually present with a ‘popping’ sound with concomitant sudden swelling and ecchymosis of the penis followed by rapid detumescence. Urethral involvement occurs only in a small part of the cases. Isolated spongiosal injury after sexual intercourse is also extremely rare. The cardinal sign of urethral injury is blood at the meatus. A small laceration can be repaired by simple closure with absorbable sutures, while a complete rupture requires a more complex anastomotic repair. We report a case of a typically presenting penile fracture that was eventually proven to be an isolated corpus spongiosum injury, with no corpora cavernosa involvement.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",3,2018

All Rights Reserved.Objective: the aim of our study was to put forward insights to treat any possible correlation among sperm quality, sperm DNA damage and male age as they may have fertility implications for men who choose to delay fatherhood. Materials and methods: Our study is a non-interventional retrospective analysis of 3124 semen samples from patients that were investigated for the conventional semen parameters. Tunel test assay was set up for the evaluation of the sperm DNA fragmentation index (DFI). We applied the Kappa index to compare both the 1999 and the 2010 World Health Organization (WHO) reference criteria to evaluate the competence of such semen parameters categorization during the standard routine of our laboratory. Results: With regards to our findings, it is possible to underline a significant relationship between aging and semen volume (p = 0.001), motility (p = 0.009), semen viscosity (p < 0.003) and sperm DNA damage (p < 0.009). We found a trend when focusing on the semen concentration (p = 0.05). The analysis of sperm morphology did not show any influence with advancing age (p = 0.606). When comparing both the 1999 and the 2010 WHO scales we found no accordance in the appraisal of sperm morphology but a very good one in the evaluation of the other parameters. Conclusions: Conventional semen analysis represents the opportunity to draw up a proxy insight on the male fertility status even if semen quality can only indirectly assess the probability of pregnancy. Several studies have verified a decay in the male reproductive system, sperm quality and fertility with advancing age although the reported results are not yet conclusive. Our results substantially agree with those findings outlined in the literature. Moreover we find that the discrepancy between the two WHO reference scales would eventually lead to an improper diagnosis of infertility.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",21,2018

All rights reserved.The supply chain dynamics has been broadly examined and experienced by the academes, industrialists as well as economists. However, still the literature is missing with the effect of economic indicators on supply chain performance, particularly in fishing industry. Therefore, the objective of the current study is to examine the role of economic indicators on supply chain performance in fishing industry of Indonesia. Economic indicators such as interest rate, inflation rate and human development index (HDI) has relationship with supply chain performance. Increases or decrease in interest and inflation has direct effect on the supply of fish products which ultimately influence the whole supply chain performance. Fishing industry is one of the industries which is working from many centuries and now growing rapidly and considered to be the important element of economic growth in different countries like Indonesia. Six hypotheses were formulated with the help of previous studies, concerning the relationship between inflation rate, interest rate, human development index (HDI), gross domestic product (GDP) and supply chain performance. GDP was considered as the mediating variable. Managerial employees of fishing companies were selected as the respondents of this study. Primary data was collected by conducting the questionnaire survey. Total number of one hundred and ninety-six (196) responses was received. These responses were analysed with the help of statistical software namely; Partial Least Square (PLS). It was found that economic indicators have influence on supply chain performance. Increases in inflation rate and interest rate decreases the supply chain performance. However, increases in HDI enhances the GDP and promote supply chain performance. Additionally, GDP is a mediating variable between HDI and supply chain which positively enhances the supply chain performance through HDI. Thus, study provides the clues for government to promote supply chain performance by controlling inflation and interest rate.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",54,2018

All rights reserved.This study analyses a unique aspect of the speed of adjustment to optimal debt levels in an emerging market by accounting for the impact of State Affiliated Directors (SAD) on internal governance mechanisms. The paper is motivated based view where firms adjust to reach an optimal level of debt ratio as well as the agency problem arising from the separation of ownership and control leading to conflicting interests between managers and shareholders in order to maximize firm value, which could ultimately impede shareholders wealth maximization. Furthermore, the potential for conflict between controlling and minority shareholders are also captured in the appointment of directors linked to the state. The authors, therefore, evaluate the presence of state affiliated directors and their potential to compromise board independence, which may lead to sub-optimal financing decisions. Analyzing firms below target levels, the study finds that the presence of SAD allows firms below target levels to adjust at more rapid rates given the potential for favorable treatment while obtaining credit financing from financial institutions. Contrastingly, the findings, however, show that firms which exceed target leverage levels tend to adjust at more rapid rates in the absence of SAD on boards. The study results point towards the reluctance of these firms to raise financing in equity markets given the possible dilution of ownership of controlling shareholders as well as the reluctance to reduce debt levels. The findings are consistent regardless of measuring debt based on book or market values and across randomized measures of board composition implying that the presence of SAD alters the dynamics of the cost of capital and thus managerial financing decisions.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",80,2018

All rights reserved.The Social media represents, without a doubt, the most important avenue of communication on the modern Internet and the foremost tool of Web 2.0 technology. Its roots can be found in the ancient groupware technology, but its modern applications are beyond anything those users of old could have imagined. In recent years, it has morphed yet again, incorporating the prevalent new mobile technology as its delivery mechanism. The term “social media”, coined by Chris Shipley, includes the sum of the online tools and utilities that allow communication, participation and collaboration, including blogs and micro-blogs, social networking sites, wikis, podcasts and videocasts, social bookmarking and virtual worlds. At the end of 2015, over 2 billion users worldwide could access social media accounts and interact with one another on mobile phones, thus generating a wealth of data to be mined by marketers all over the world. However, this unprecedented access to consumer data (in conjunction with multiple user connections) has raised a number of privacy concerns, which have only grown in the last few years. This paper, detailing a study conducted for over a year on a wide variety of subjects, aims at interdisciplinary development of a clustering model based on both usage and perception variables, coupled with various psychographic predictor items, such as users’ attitude towards social media, users’ utilitarian and hedonic motivation, normative beliefs, perceived self-efficacy, various lifestyle variables, as well as overall trust and perception of privacy-associated risks. The proposed model is developed using discriminant analysis and it allows us to put forward four different user groups in terms of privacy concerns over social media. The management implications of our findings are also discussed and innovative ways proposed to deal with the ethical issues associated with the ever-growing lack of online privacy.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",31,2018

The paper concentrates on artistic collaborations and on collaborations with art heritage in cases where an artist has passed away but their paintings inspire designers and become interpreted and implemented into a luxury brand. These collaborations bring strong emotional and symbolic values for consumers as e.g. aesthetic pleasure, as well as feelings of being an art connoisseur and a part of global cultural elite. Moreover, luxury items with visual artistic elements (LIVAE) can provoke an interest in the arts and create educational value for people.

In times of economic and financial crises, therefore, the emphasis of management decisions are shifting to corporate efficiency and effectiveness since the available internal corporate resources sources as well as the external ones are shrinking or becoming uncertain. The reason for the appreciation of the going concern assumption is that the actors of the national economy may suffer serious operational difficulties in case the principle is not properly implemented; whether it is coming from the side of banks, corporate or public services. The purpose of the study is threefold: on the one hand, to demonstrate the going concern assumption and its appreciation in the context of a literature review with special regard to international auditor standards and IFRS, (International Financial Reporting Standards) on the other hand to show the empirical results based on the questionnaire survey on large corporations of the Visegrad countries (Hungary, Poland, Slovakia and the Czech Republic) and the authors demonstrate the supporting functions of the going concern assumption in the controlling systems.✉ lentner.csaba@uni-nke.hu.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",26,2018

All rights reserved.The research problem of the paper concerns multiple catalysts for the development of cross-border cooperation in Euroregions, and in particular their impact on public institutions and NGOs. The aim of the paper is to determine whether in a specific Euroregion environment, cooperating public institutions and non-governmental organizations are affected by similar or different catalysts for the development of cross-border cooperation. Based on the literature review as well as desk research analyze, the theoretical part of the paper presents three key sets of catalysts for the development of cross-border cooperation, related to: the adopted model of cooperation; cooperating organizations; implemented cross-border activities. In order to solve the paper’s research problem the qualitative research were conducted. The co-authors analysed the results of focus group interviews and a survey conducted on a group of 100 Polish and Czech respondents developing cross-border cooperation in the Polish and Czech part of the Beskidy Euroregion were used. The sets of catalysts: “the model of cooperation”, “the resources and potential of partners” refer in a universal way to the processes of development of cross-border cooperation, while the third set-joint activities of partners is strongly correlated with Euroregional determinants. The analysis confirms that for nongovernmental organizations the strong catalysts for the development of cross-border cooperation are the resources and potentials of the cooperating organizations and joint activities of the partners, while the set including the cooperation model is not important. On the other hand, in the case of public institutions, the cooperation model and the resources and potentials of cooperating organizations can be considered weak catalysts, while the set including joint activities of partners is not important.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",25,2018

We fabricated different surface patterns of lotus and taro leaves on Si surfaces and compared their contact angles and tribological properties. Three types of lotus patterns, consisting of a simple dot matrix of circular pillars with different pitches, and six types of taro patterns having the pillars distributed within a field of hexagonal ridges with different central pillar diameters and pitches, were prepared. The contact angles of water and hexadecane on these patterns were measured, and the wear resistance of each pattern was evaluated by reciprocating wear tests. The taro pattern showed a significantly higher contact angle for hexadecane and a lower coefficient of friction than the lotus pattern. The taro pattern ridges are supposed to contain air in the valleys between the ridges and pillars, which prevented sticking between the pillars and cloth fibers. Thus, the taro pattern exhibits better oleophobicity and a lower frictional force.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",12,2018

Both design can be classified into two, bearing with seal and without seal. Air was chosen to replace the oil as the lubricant. Results show that the modified spiral bearing design has comparable characteristics compared to conventional spiral design in terms of pressure and velocity distribution. Modified spiral geometries also shows a tendency to replace the function of seals in FDB. This makes it possible to simplify bearing design without using any seal just by modifying its geometries based on novel modified spiral geometries.

The slippage phenomenon is a serious problem in the manufacturing of thin films, because it prevents continuous production and associated costs will increase. Therefore, the roller should be modified in order to mitigate the effects of slippage. To study the modified roller surface, an experimental apparatus was designed. The driving roller was modified to add holes, and an acrylic chamber covered the experimental apparatus to control air temperature. The specific web examined in this study was Polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The experiment showed that the roller with holes is an effective alternative for reducing slippage of web.

Relative clauses, which function as a kind of noun phrase post-modifier, are among those structures that are believed to contribute to the complexity of academic prose. These grammatical structures can pose difficulties for EFL writers even at higher levels of proficiency, and it is therefore important to determine the frequency and accuracy with which relative clauses are used by L2 learners since understanding learners' strengths and weaknesses in using these structures can inform teachers on ways to improve the process of their instruction in the writing classroom. This paper reports on a corpus-based comparison of relative clauses in a number of argumentative essays written by native and non-native speakers of English. To this end, 30 argumentative essays were randomly selected from the Persian sub-corpus of the ICLE and the essays were analyzed with respect to the relative clauses found in them. The results were then compared to a comparable corpus of essays by native speakers. Different dimensions regarding the structure of relative clauses were investigated. The type of relative clause (restrictive/non-restrictive), the relativizer (adverbial/pronoun), the gap (subject/nonsubject), and head nouns (both animate and non-animate) in our two sets of data were manually identified and coded. The findings revealed that the non-native writers tended to use a greater number of relative clauses compared to their native-speaker counterparts.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",29,2018

A number of scientists have found support for the importance of learner autonomy but there is little empirical research on using different strategies for promoting and evaluating students' autonomy. Accordingly, in order to become better language learners, students should plan, implement, and evaluate their own learning. This study aims at fostering and evaluating students' autonomy by scaffolding their speaking practices through role plays in an English for Special Purposes (ESP) course. The research suggests that role-play strategies should help students develop their autonomy in acquiring ESP speaking skills. The study argues that developing autonomy is an efficient way to improve students' performance in ESP speaking skills as it provides them with relevant scaffolding. This article provides theoretical grounding for autonomy. The entry-level and post-study speaking scores (IELTS test) are compared across experimental and control groups. A class-based training course of ESP speaking was offered in an institutional setting to 38 (15 male, 23 female) second-year students at a national research university in Russia. A special questionnaire was developed to assess learner autonomy in ESP speaking, which proved that role play promoted learner autonomy and encouraged students to master ESP speaking skills. The results of the study indicate that students who were developing their speaking skills via role play performed significantly better than their peers in the control group. The level of their English language competence improved. The role plays in the ESP speaking course proved to be a viable and productive teaching strategy for fostering autonomy among students.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",31,2018

The participants were software engineering and computer science first-year students, and they were selected using a multistage sampling technique. Observation, a questionnaire, and pre-and post-tests were employed as data gathering instruments. The research was designed through a time series quasi-experimental research design. The data were analysed through repeated measure ANOVA, independent t-tests, as well as descriptive statistics. The findings indicated that there was a statistical difference between the experimental and the control groups. Hence, students who participated in mastery learning instruction improved their writing skills and achieved better scores in writing skills assessment. Particularly, learners who learned through mastery learning instruction were able to develop paragraphs and essays with clear topic sentences and thesis statements. They also developed paragraphs with proper punctuation and minimized various mechanical errors that were observed during the pre-test. Furthermore, the students who engaged in mastery learning instruction had better levels of motivation. Thus, individualized instruction and continuous feedback helped them improve their engagement in writing activities. Hence, this study calls for more attention to self-paced instruction, regular feedback, assessment, and continuous support in writing classrooms.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",54,2018

The LAs in this program consisted of Japanese study abroad students, that is English as a second language students, coming to study from Japanese universities for either one semester or one academic year, as well as American learners returning from a one-year academic study abroad program in Japan. In the southeastern region of the United States, the Japanese language is not yet considered a major foreign language, thus few opportunities exist for American learners to connect with native speakers of Japanese. The LA program endeavors to ease this limitation. It has been extremely beneficial for our American learners to have opportunities to communicate regularly with Japanese study abroad students in the classrooms. Furthermore, it was found tremendously valuable for Japanese study abroad students and greatly helpful for the instructors as well. This paper describes the procedures and examines the effectiveness of introducing an LA program into Japanese language classes. To analyze the program, questionnaires were distributed to LAs (N=20); five department instructors wrote comments concerning the program; and five Japanese language learners submitted reflection papers. Analyses of the qualitative data indicate that the LA program has many advantages for everyone participating.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",12,2018

Despite this apparent agreement, government reform of the US public school system has proven contentious and challenging for both political parties. New data from a diversity of sources allow us to examine the more contentious aspects of school-funding policy and offer insight as to why education-funding reform has been difficult. We find that from 1998 to 2016, citizens were remarkably consistent in their opinions on general questions of school funding. However, there has been substantial disagreement and change in the public opinion toward national versus local school funding, tying teacher salaries to student performance, and specific methods of increasing school choice. This macro-level stability and consistency and micro-level instability and inconsistency may help explain why implementing reform remains difficult even though the desire for reform is widespread.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",13,2018

To analyze the state of the art of using meta-Analyses in survey methodology, previous meta-Analyses are systematically identified and classified according to the thematic areas the analyses address. This is followed by identifying gaps in research (i.e., areas where there are few or no existing meta-Analyses) and investigating potential avenues for future meta-Analyses in this field. The findings are based on a systematic search of two bibliographic harvesters (together covering 265 bibliographic databases), which yielded 54 eligible manuscripts reporting 60 meta-Analytic studies and 91 effect sizes. To identify the thematic areas, the effect sizes are structured according to seven categories of the total survey error (TSE). Characteristics of primary studies that potentially influence the variability of meta-Analytic findings also are considered, such as the survey mode, questionnaire design, and sample characteristics. The results show that the thematic areas of these meta-Analyses cover only two of the seven TSE categories: measurement and nonresponse error. Thematic areas in the remaining TSE categories are not covered, and the key practical implication is that gaps exist in current research. Regarding the methodology of existing meta-Analyses in the survey methodology field, there are fundamental differences in reporting styles in terms of transparency and replicability, calling for a concerted effort to develop meta-Analytic reporting standards for survey methodology.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",38,2018

Assuming the public agenda's capacity to be relatively fixed, scholars have argued that increasing agenda diversity must exert upward pressure on volatility, generating issue competition. This study reveals that the public agenda has continued to diversify, but volatility has changed little; indeed, the agenda was less volatile in 2014 than it had been in decades. Moreover, issue-carrying capacity has grown, raising questions about the traditionally posited limits of the public agenda's issue-carrying capacity. Issue-carrying capacity is positively related to agenda diversity and negatively related to volatility.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",41,2018

Guided by feelings-As-information theory (FIT;Schwarz 2011), the first study presents an experiment (N = 1,018) in which the language difficulty of public opinion questions was varied. Findings suggest that language difficulty affected metacognitive experiences, which in turn affected reports of political interest, political efficacy, don't know responding, and ideological constraint. Study 2 (N = 1,817) presents cross-sectional evidence from publicly available data that also indicates question-language difficulty influences don't know responding. Given these findings, study 3 (N = 8,090) presents a content analysis that reveals significant systematic variability in language difficulty within polling questions across 10 polling firms in 2016. Contextualizing these findings within a FIT framework, we contend that variability in language difficulty differentially and systematically affects participants' metacognitive experiences while responding to public opinion questions. Given that metacognitive experiences affect survey response, language difficulty ought to be more carefully considered when drafting opinion questions. To this end, the data presented in these studies can be used to aid question construction by providing numeric guidelines, using widely available measures that contextualize the relative difficulty of survey language. It is also recommended that items assessing metacognitive experiences be included in survey research to account for variance in this measure. At a time when polling data are ubiquitous yet polling accuracy is being called into question, it is critical to identify sources of unmeasured error within polling data.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",48,2018

Evidence from Administrative Data,Public Opinion Quarterly,"[('U.S. Census Bureau', 'Washington, D.C.', 'United States')]","© Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Association for Public Opinion Research 2018.Many surveys ask respondents to consult financial records in order to improve data accuracy. However, the assumption that record use reduces measurement error has not been tested with a large-scale comparison to administrative data. This paper compares interest, dividend, and rental income in the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) to administrative IRS 1040 tax data. In a novel estimation strategy, we use various measures of respondent motivation and precision to account for nonrandom selection. Our results show that record use is associated with reducing the discrepancy between survey and administrative data by approximately 21 to 43 percent. In terms of potential costs from encouraging record use, record users spend an extra 3.5 seconds for each asset question, on average, after controlling for their behavior in other parts of the SIPP interview. The extra time per question translates to a 2.2 percent increase in the total duration of the interview. Thus, while record use may be an effective tool for improving data accuracy, it may come at the cost of higher interviewer compensation and increased respondent burden.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",19,2018

This study investigates whether partisans from different parties react the same to changes in policy (as implied by the parallel-publics literature), or differently (as implied by the partisanship literature). I argue that we should see important differences in policy feedback between partisan groups, but only on salient policies that have large disagreement across partisan lines. To test this expectation, I use the thermostatic model of opinion-policy feedback, relying on data from the 1973-2014 General Social Survey. Findings indicate that partisans react differently to policy in issue areas with relatively large disagreement. This finding enhances our understanding of the interaction between partisan control of government and partisanship in the opinion-policy process.

A voltage-control spintronics memory (VoCSM) which has a potential of low energy consumption uses the spin-Hall effect (SHE) and the voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effect for its write operation.

In the fabrication process, we develop highly-selective patterning process to stop MTJ etching precisely on the surface of the SHE electrode.

To study the degree of medical radiation exposure, we measured and analyzed the lead apron’s shielding rate on direct radiation dose according to the quality of radiation beam. The distribution of space dispersal dose at X-ray exam was also measured at X-ray test on chest (100 kVp, 4 mAs, 100 mA) and L-spine AP (76 kVp, 200 mA, 32 mAs) to find out a better method to shield the worker’s radiation exposure. To measure the quality of X-ray in the scope of voltage generally used for X-ray exam in the hospital, half-value layer was estimated at the voltages which is ranged from 40 to 120 kVp. Effective energy was estimated at the same voltage range and the result was 12.5 keV~39.9 keV. The result of measuring radiation dose at increasing the voltage by 10 kVp each time on the range of 40~120 kVp, showed that the shielding rate of 0.50 mm Pb lead apron is superior to that of 0.25 mm Pb lead apron for all ranges of voltage. The difference of shielding rate between 0.50 mm Pb and 0.25 mm Pb lead apron increased as the voltage increased. The maximum difference was 10.2 % at 120 kVp. In conclusion, the lead apron will be able to shield the worker’s radiation exposure, especially for high voltage application for the exam, with understanding of space dispersal dose.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",13,2018

Because the reed switch manufacturer arranges the magnetic properties of the reed switch in Ampere-Turns and it is an uncomfortable dimension for an analytical estimation, it is not easy for the reed switch users to estimate the operability of a reed switch application at the design stage.

The operability of a reed switch application has been proved to be affected by the electromagnetic field generated around the application or an adjacent reed switch itself.

If hall sensor fault occurs, ripple occurs in torque and current output value of BLDC motor. In addition, a phenomenon such as rapid braking of the motor may occur.

Weak ferromagnetism and an exchange bias up to 17.1 mT were observed in these antiferromagnetic nanoparticles, owing to the presence of a large fraction of the uncompensated surface spins and possibly the local disordered regions.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",18,2018

All Rights Reserved.Exposure to light is very important for human health. However, the characteristics of the light stimulus and the appropriate timing of such exposure are essential. Studies that have used monochromatic light exposure have shown no systematic patterns for the effects of blue light compared to longer wavelengths. Previous studies have shown that red light exposure increases objective and subjective measures of alertness at night without suppressing nocturnal melatonin or inducing circadian disruption. The present study investigated whether noon time exposure to red light would increase both objective and subjective measures of alertness such as those measured by EEG, cognitive-behavioral performance, and subjective sleepiness. The three lighting conditions were as follows: dim light (< 0.01 lux at cornea), blue light (465 nm, 72 μW/cm2), and red light (625 nm, 18 μW/cm2), both at 40 lux. The results of the EEG data showed an increase in theta power over time in dim light only. In red light, alpha power showed a decrease over time. The impact of red light was observed in the performance measures: The only significant effect was a deterioration in the continuous performance test after red light exposure. Subjective measures of alertness were not affected by light in either condition, in contrast to darkness, when subjects reported greater sleepiness than before. None of the changes in objective measures of alertness induced by red light exposure translated into subjective sleepiness at noon. Thus, we concluded that behavioral effects of light at noon are very limited at best.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",75,2018

Darwiniana, nueva serie 6(2): 133-143. The richness of ferns and lycophytes associated with the semi-deciduous forests of southern Brazil remains poorly known. Addressing this situation, the richness of lycophytes and ferns in 11 semi-deciduous forest remnants, located in the northwestern region of Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil, is presented. In total, four species of lycophytes (two families and two genera) and 88 species of ferns (15 families and 44 genera) were recorded. The most diverse families were Pteridaceae and Polypodiaceae, with 18 and 17 species respectively; Asplenium (10 spp.) was the most diverse genus. Among the recorded species, only Dicksonia sellowiana is cited in the Brazilian List of Threatened Plant Species. Most of the surveyed species have a broad distribution, occurring in South America (44.6%) and Tropical America (32.6%). The surveyed remnants showed intermediate species richness in relation to other areas previously studied in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, except for Parque Estadual do Turvo, where 81 species were recorded. The floristic similarity analysis shows that the Parque Estadual do Turvo is the most dissimilar area, presenting a high number (28) of exclusive species. The observed high value of the cophenetic correlation coefficient (0.968), indicate a small distortion between the similarity matrix and multidimensional space shown in the dendrogram. The present study constitutes an important contribution to the knowledge of the richness of ferns and lycophytes occurring in semi-deciduous forests in southern Brazil.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",71,2018

All Rights Reserved.In view of the unresolved mind–brain problem, we examine a number of prototypical research attitudes regarding the question, how the mental and the neuronal realms are related to each other, both functionally and ontologically. By discussing neurophilosophical and neuropsychological positions, the mind–brain problem can be recast in terms of a structural relation between methodological and content-related aspects. Although this reformulation does not immediately lead to a solution, it draws attention to the necessity of searching for a new way of balancing separating and integrating elements regarding content as well as method. As a relatively unknown alternative in this context we investigate an approach by the philosopher Rudolf Steiner. It comprises a first-person method, along with the theoretical background of what has come to be known as the mirror metaphor – an analogy for the brain as a necessary but not a sufficient basis for mental activity. Through a first-person study, this approach is scrutinized using volitionally controlled perceptual reversals. The results allow for a phenomenological distinction of processual phases which can be summarized as engaging and disengaging forms of mental activity. Finally, we initiate a discussion in view of related philosophical concepts and give an outlook on the next possible research steps.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",84,2018

This study aims to create a new visual version of a reasoning task, similar to the traditional propositional task of relational syllogisms, but based on visuospatial components. Using such a task, it would be possible to investigate the deductive ability of relational inferences in tests without the need for reading. Two reasoning tasks were used and measures of working memory, visuospatial memory, intelligence, and reading comprehension were taken. The participants were 61 university students without reading difficulties. Results show that both versions of the reasoning task work similarly in finding the main reasoning effects expected. Findings support the visual impedance effect, that is, fewer correct responses in problems with imaginable contents than with neutral ones. They indicate that this new visual task could be used to explore reasoning skills without reading being involved, and this would be useful for testing reasoning in people both with and without reading difficulties.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",37,2018

Only those publications with contributions to Argentine fungal diversity were included. A total of 314 articles were incorporated to the analyses. Our results indicate an exponential trend in the production of knowledge in native fungal diversity and showed important collaboration networks between institutes at the national and international level. The data suggest a trend towards the decentralization of human resources and towards regional capacity building. The ratification of the CBD and the Nagoya Protocol in Argentina has promoted changes in regulatory frameworks, but their impact on the scientific and technological field is not clear.

The review indicates that people frequently use spontaneous strategies based on a search for structural, semantic, and contextual information about the target person. On the other hand, both cueing and priming experimental studies have shown that providing phonological information may help resolve a recall failure, whereas providing structural or semantic information is usually not helpful. A possible explanation of this discrepancy between the spontaneous use of semantic/contextual information and the experimentally demonstrated uselessness of this kind of information is provided.

Optimization of acidic chloride bath containing triethanolamine and citric acid for deposition of a smooth and uniform Zn-Ni alloy coating over mild steel is discussed in the present work. Bath constituents and operating parameters were optimized by standard Hull cell method. Triethanolamine and citric acid were used as additives altered the phase content in the coatings, most likely as a result of their adsorption at the surface of the cathode. The effect of citric acid was more pronounced than that of triethanolamine. The composition of coatings was determined by using colorimetric method. The bath followed anomalous codeposition with preferential deposition of Zn over nobler metal Ni. The experimental results reveal that a bright Zn-Ni alloy coating having ~4.92 wt.%Ni was showing peak performance of the coating against corrosion. Deposition was carried out under different condition of current densities and molar ratio of [Ni +2 ]/[Zn +2 ]. No transition current densities at which codeposition behaviour changed from anomalous to normal type was observed. The cathode current efficiency was higher than 80%. As the current density was increased or the bath temperature was decreased, the concentration of the nobler metal in the coating was increased. The thickness and hardness of all coatings increased as the applied current density was increased. The throwing power and reflectance of the coating was increased with current density to a peak value, and then decreased.

A molecular imprinted polymer (MIP)-based biomimetic sensing device was constructed for the analysis of clarithromycin (CM). The novel MIP was prepared using a methacrylic acid (MAA) (functional monomer) and Ethylene glycol dimethylacrylate (EGDMA) (cross-linker) and the target species (i.e.CM) as the template molecule. The resulting MIP had considerable adsorption capacity and excellent selectivity toward CM compound. After some experiments, optimum 1:6 mole ratio of template to MAA was selected for the synthesis of CM MIP. The non-covalent CM-MIP was used for the construction of a potentiometric sensor for CM. The proposed had selective and sensitive response to CM concentration in aqueous media. The electrode response had a Nernstian response of 50.8±1.0 mV decade−1from 1.0×10-6 to 5.0×10-3 M and had a detection limit as low as 8.0×10 -7 M. The response time of the electrode was about 15 s, and it had a long-term stability of over 45 days. The sensor also proved applicable to the analysis of CM concentration in tablets with good sensitivity and accuracy.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",52,2018

A novel, simple, convenient, inexpensive and green voltammetric sensing for iron in human blood serum was developed. The method is based on linear sweep voltammetry at an iodine-coated polycrystalline platinum electrode. A miniaturized home-made small scale 0.5-mL cell was used for the analysis. Oxidation of iron at the iodine-coated platinum electrode was manifested by a peak centered at 0.5 V. The established calibration curve for the relationship between iron (II) concentration and current extracted from the linear sweep voltammograms revealed an excellent linearity(R 2 =0.9923). The calculated lowest detection limit, LOD, is 0.26 ppm and the limit of quantification is 0.87 ppm. Recovery studies for a concentration of 1.0 ppm yielded a value of 1.02 ppm (102% percent recovery). No interference with other common essential elements in blood serum was observed which attests to the suitability and accuracy of the method.

Sivakumar, et al., published by Sciendo.The construction industry in India is the country's second largest industrial sector, after agriculture. The construction industry makes a remarkable contribution to the Indian economy and provides employment to a large number of people of India. Fire is a chemical reaction of a combustible substance with oxygen, involving heat and is usually accompanied by a visual flame or incandescence. Ensuring fire safety has always been a challenge to the stakeholders, i.e. building owners, construction companies, contractors and sub-contractors, and government employees due to the multiplicity of the factors involved and their complexity. There are various legal standards and requirements for ensuring fire safety on construction sites. The buildings are normally provided with firewalls during construction and these firewalls separate two structures or divide a structure into smaller portions to prevent the spread of fire. The lightweight construction and trusses are designed to support only their own weight. During a fire, if one fails, a domino effect happens and all fail rapidly within 5 to 10 minutes. Prolonged exposure to fire may result in structural collapse and injury or death of the occupants of the building under construction. Fire safety on construction sites is still in its primitive stages in India. There is a great necessity to improve fire safety on construction sites to protect construction workers and other occupants of the buildings. This study aims to design and implement fire safety systems for construction sites, thereby enhancing the standards to meet the system requirements at par with global standards.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",11,2018

Methods Seventy-six severe burn patients with burns covering a total body surface area (TBSA) above 70% were included in this study. Of the 76 patients, 29 cases developed MODS (MODS group) and the remaining 47 subjects did not (non-MODS group). From the MODS group, 12 patients died (Death group) and 17 patients survived (Survive group). The serum level of neopterin in the MODS and non-MODS groups were examined by radioimmunoassay on following 1, 3 , 7 , 14 , 21 and 28 post-burn days (PBDs). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyse the predictive value of serum neopterin for MODS and death. Results The serum neopterin level in the MODS group was significantly higher than that of non-MODS group between 3~28 PBDs (p<0.001). However, the serum neopterin levels between the MODS and non-MODS groups following 1 PBD were not statistically significant (p>0.05). The best diagnostic performance of serum neopterin for MODS occurred 14 PBDs with the prediction sensitivity and specificity of 75.86% (56.46%~89.70%) and 85.11% (71.69%~93.80%) respectively. However, serum neopterin levels had no clinical value in predicting the death of MODS patients. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.72 (0.58~0.85), 0.81 (0.71~0.92) and 0.83 (0.72~0.94) for serum neopterin as biomarker in the prediction of MODS after 3, 7 and 14 PBDs, respectively.

Conclusion The persistent and significant increase of serum neopterin level is closely related to the development of MODS in patients with severe burns. Serum neopterin is therefore a promising serological marker for MODS early diagnosis, but has little efficacy in the prediction of the likelihood of death in severe burn patients with MODS.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",23,2018

Shallal, Aqil Mousa K. Al Musawi, published by Sciendo.Reinforced concrete is one of the most widely used structural components about which much scientific research has been conducted; however, some of its characteristics still require further research. The main focus of this study is the effect of direct fire on the shear transfer strength of concrete. It was investigated under several parameters including concrete strength, number of stirrup legs (the steel area across the shear plane), and fire duration. The experimental program involved the testing of two sets (groups) of specimens (12 specimens each) with different concrete strengths. Each set contained specimens of two or four stirrup legs exposed to direct fire from one side (the fire was in an open area to simulate a real-life event) for a duration of one, two, and three hours. The results of the comparison showed the importance of using high-performance concrete (instead of increasing the number of stirrup legs) to resist shear stress for the purpose of safety. A significant reduction in shear strength occurred due to the deterioration of the concrete cover after three hours of direct fire exposure.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",18,2018

This research estimates the current and forecasts the future changes of farm size and labor occupational mobility over time and across the region. A panel dataset, which is used in this study, was collected in the three different years (1988, 2000 and 2008) from 62 villages across 57 districts. Stationary Markov chain approach was used in this analysis to estimate structural change. The results of this study imply that the agricultural sector is dominated by small farms in past, present and also in the future. The forecasting predicts that the numbers of marginal, medium and large farms are going to decrease in future. Moreover, it indicates that the average farm size of small landholders will slightly increase as the numbers of marginal and large landowners reduces. The analyses of the transition probabilities of labor occupational change show that rural households are gradually shifting to non-farm activities and mostly part-time farming from other income generating activities over time. In general, the forecast also suggests narrowing of agricultural activities and expansion of part-time farming and non-farm activities in future.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",17,2018

Both diseases are characterized by chronic inflammation of unclear etiology. The inflammatory bowel diseases incidence is continuously observed to rise. Colon inflammatory response is a physiological process which occurrence is indispensable as an organisms' defense reaction. The inflammation may be caused by internal factors associated with body's cells as well as external factors, such as infections and exposition for inflammatory agents. Until recently, IBD have been classified as autoimmune diseases, today they seem to be associated with gut barrier disorders or dysbiosis. Factors that predispose to inflammatory bowel diseases include: Genetic factors, dysbiosis and so called western-type diet, natural components such as gluten and lactose. In addition, the development of the disease is favored by: Cigarette smoking, phosphate, nanomolecules, sodium chloride, emulgents, carrageenan, carboxymethylcellulose, pollution, maltodextrin. IBD affects whole the body, causing serious medical consequences. Symptoms like anxiety and chronic stress, that occur commonly, can lead to depressive disorders. Quantitative and qualitative dietary deficiency caused by absorption disorders, may promote the occurrence of osteoporosis and osteopenia. In addition, dysbiosis coexisting with alterations in intestinal permeability can lead to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. IBD medical consequences include also systemic complications, associated with the extra gastrointestinal manifestations' occurrence.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",73,2018

In order to bridge this gap in literature, we conducted a TFP decomposition exercise using dairy farm summary records from the New York state which is one of the historically major milk producing regions of the United States. Stochastic frontier models with air temperature, incorporated as an environmental input in an otherwise conventional dairy production function, are estimated using an unbalanced panel of constructed 'average' dairy farms of various size-classes covering a sufficiently long time-period. Change in TFP is then decomposed into various components namely technological change, technical efficiency change, and scale efficiency change. Further analysis also establishes that the introduction of average air temperature in the stochastic production frontier soaks what otherwise could be attributed to inefficiency and/or model residual.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",27,2018

Simultaneously, beef farming contributes significant environmental impacts. To support farmers, actors from the whole value chain are now promoting Swedish beef as particularly ‘sustainable’. The paper draws on critical discourse analysis of interviews with and documents from the largest Swedish supermarket chain ICA, Swedish farmer organisations and farmers to study how ICA and farmers articulate sustainability and their responsibility for the same. Articulations are subsequently discussed in the light of actual environmental impacts of beef production and the distribution of power in the beef value chain. The findings suggest that negative environmental impacts and farmers’ struggles are largely hidden in the dominant articulation of sustainability. Furthermore, ICA does not use the power it has to steer consumers toward reduced beef consumption. We conclude with suggesting more open deliberation about current levels of beef sales and consumption and about what compromises to make when striving for ‘sustainable’ beef consumption.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",63,2018

Treatment groups (n = 18/group) received nobiletin (12.5, 25, or 50 mg/kg) via oral gavage for 6 consecutive days and 45 min prior to PTZ injection. CZP (0.015-2.0 mg/kg) was administered 15 min prior to PTZ. Skeletal muscle strength was assessed by measuring grip strength and Chimney test was performed to study the motor performance in animals. TUNEL assay was done to study neuro-apoptosis. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis were performed for assessment of mRNA and protein expressions. Nobiletin and CZP improved muscle strength and motor coordination and reduced seizure severity significantly. The administration of nobiletin and CZP, individually or in combination, downregulated seizure-induced increases in apoptotic cell count and apoptotic protein expression, modulated the expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A and glutamate decarboxylase 65 and restored the glutamate/GABA balance. Nobiletin and CZP administration significantly upregulated phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt) signaling.

DNA hydroxymethylation, however, has been sparsely investigated in aging and AD. We have previously reported robust decreases in 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) in the hippocampus of AD patients compared to non-demented controls. In the present study, we investigated 3- and 9-month-old APPswe/PS1ΔE9 transgenic and wild-type mice for possible age-related alterations in 5-mC and 5-hmC levels in three hippocampal sub-regions using quantitative immunohistochemistry. While age-related increases in levels of both 5-mC and 5-hmC were found in wild-type mice, APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice showed decreased levels of 5-mC at 9 months of age and no age-related changes in 5-hmC throughout the hippocampus.

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the UK Environmental Mutagen Society. All rights reserved.There remain significant uncertainties in estimation of risks with low doses of radiation. The small coastal belt in the southwestern state of Kerala, India, extending from Neendakara in the south to Purakkad in the north is one of the most extensively studied high-level natural background radiation areas (HLNRAs) of the world to address these concerns. The natural radioactivity here is due to occurrence of monazite sand bearing placer deposits along the coastline. In this study, proteomic approach was employed to study the response of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from individuals residing in HLNRA (N = 10; mean radiation dose: 15.60 ± 3.04 mGy/y) vis-à-vis responses in individuals from adjoining normal-level natural background radiation areas (NLNRA; N = 10; mean radiation dose: ≤1.50 mGy/y) using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry. A total of 15 proteins were found to be statistically altered in individuals from HLNRA when compared to individuals from NLNRA (P ≤ 0.05). Most of the changes in expression were small. The mean coefficient of variation for the differentially altered proteins was found to be ∼34%. Pathway enrichment analysis with Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery distinguished 44 biological processes significantly (P ≤ 0.05) modulated in HLNRA samples. More importantly, when challenged with an ex vivo dose of 2 Gy, HLNRA PBMCs responded with an up-regulation of many protective pro-survival proteins such as protein disulfide-isomerase A1 (PDIA1), peroxiredoxin 6 (PRDX6) and glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78). PDIA1 and PRDX6 are known to play an important role in redox homeostasis. GRP78 is considered the master regulator of unfolded protein response that aims to restore endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis and thus, regulate cell survival. Principal component analysis identified clear clusters based on radiation dose. The expression changes of key proteins were validated by western blotting using additional samples from HLNRA and NLNRA. This indicates that the human cells respond to low dose of ionising radiation through dynamic changes in the proteome to maintain adaptive homeostasis. These findings emphasise that the dose-response relationship at low doses of radiation may not be linear and, thus, provide mechanistic challenge to the linear-no-threshold hypothesis.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",29,2018

However, its conventional detection for in vivo samples relies on immunological methods using anti-γH2AX antibodies, making quantitative analysis difficult. Here, we established an absolute γH2AX quantification in vivo method for multiple organs in mice using liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. When applying the method to male Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice (8 weeks old), the testes showed the highest γH2AX level (2.3% of total H2AX), followed by the bone marrow (0.51%), stomach (0.28%), kidney (0.20%), spleen (0.20%), liver (0.15%) and lung, which had the lowest overall level (0.10%). After intraperitoneal administration of 2 mg/kg mitomycin C in mice, γH2AX levels increased until 2-4 h, followed by a monotonical decrease to the control level in the bone marrow and spleen, and increased moderately until 24 h, followed by a slight decrease by 48 h in the liver, stomach, lung and kidney. After oral administration of 400 mg/kg ethyl methanesulphonate, γH2AX levels increased until 8 h and then decreased to the control level by 24-48 h in the spleen and kidney, increased until 24 h and then slightly decreased until 48 h in the bone marrow and lung, increased until 8 h and plateaued by 48 h in the liver, and decreased until 8 h and then increased to the control level in the stomach. Both the genotoxic chemicals did not alter γH2AX levels in the testes. These results indicate that our novel method could reveal variation in the γH2AX state in mouse organs and allows monitoring of the in vivo dynamics induced by genotoxic chemicals.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",49,2018

It has been studied in a number of in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity assays and is considered an unusual nucleoside analogue owing to its potent mutagenic potential, with little to no measurable clastogenic activity. Given this atypical profile, CEDU represented an interesting compound for evaluating the in vivo Pig-a gene mutation assay, a test that is undergoing extensive validation for regulatory safety applications. The current report describes two studies with 7-week-old male Wistar Han rats, one that exposed animals to several dose levels of CEDU for 5 consecutive days, the other for 28 consecutive days. Blood samples were collected at several time points and analysed for Pig-a mutant cell frequencies via flow cytometry. These Pig-a analyses were accompanied by micronucleated reticulocyte (MN-RET) measurements performed with blood samples collected 1 day after cessation of treatment. Both studies showed robust CEDU dose-related increases in Pig-a mutant reticulocytes and mutant erythrocytes. Conversely, neither experiment showed evidence of a CEDU-related MN-RET-inducing effect. These rat haematopoietic cell results were in good agreement with those of earlier mouse studies where in vivo mutagenesis was observed, without clastogenicity/aneuploidy. Taken together, these data add further support to the concept that the Pig-a assay represents an important complement to the widely used in vivo micronucleus assay, as it expands the range of important DNA lesions that can be detected in short-term as well as protracted exposure study designs.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",22,2018

Most of the papers that concern medical ethics focus on ‘great’ problems, such as human genome sequencing, or-ganizms cloning and quantitative or qualitative interference with life creation. This article, however, describes practical ethical problems that the doctors face in every-day practice. First of all, the problem of how the standards of prophilaxis and treatment should be established when the costs exceed financial possibilities of a health system. Secondly, how to face the problem of rare diseases when the cost of a single patient treatment may be equal to the whole medical department budget. Thirdly, how to procede with elderly patients with multiple diseases qualified for invasive procedures. All of these examples share the common base: in these cases the technical equipment is at our disposal, yet we cannot or we do not want to use it.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",4,2018

The state of the art in the field has been set by the ESA Planck mission, launched in 2009, dedicated to precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Planck observed the full sky for 4 years in a wide frequency range, reaching µK sensitivity both in temperature and polarization. The latest results, published by the Planck Collaboration in 2018, are in exquisite agreement with the simplest 6-parameter ΛCDM model and constrain the main cosmological parameters with percent-level accuracy. Furthermore, the Planck data yield insight on the very early universe (t ∼ 10− 35s), opening the way to a new generation of experiments searching for the possible signatures of primordial gravitational waves in the CMB polarization pattern.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",25,2018

Ehaideb et al.The WWOX gene has a WW domain containing oxidoreductase, which is located at the common fragile site FRA16D at chromosome 16q23. WWOX is a tumor suppressor gene that has been associated with several types of cancer such as hepatic, breast, lung, prostate, gastric, and ovarian. Recently WWOX has been implicated in epilepsy, where studies show homozygous loss-of-function mutation lead to early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy, spinocerebellar ataxia, intractable seizures and developmental delay, and early lethal microcephaly syndrome with epilepsy. Here we investigate two consanguineous Saudi families and we identified three probands with epileptic encephalopathy. Whole exome sequencing revealed a novel homozygous mutation in the WWOX gene in one proband. In addition, we identified a previously reported WWOX mutation in two probands. Later on these findings were confirmed with Sanger sequencing. The underlying mechanism on how WWOX mutations lead to seizure remains elusive. To date very few WWOX mutations have been associated with neurological disorder and our newly identified mutations support the notion that WWOX play an important role in neurons and will aid in better diagnosis and genetic counseling.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",31,2018

Among these modifications, phosphorylation plays an important role in modulating the functional properties of proteins. Plants perceive environmental cues that directly affect the phosphorylation status of many target proteins. To determine the effect of environmentally induced phosphorylation in plants, in vivo methods must be developed. Various in vitro methods are available but, unlike in animals, there is no optimized methodology for detecting protein phosphorylation in planta. Therefore, in this study, a robust, and easy to handle Phos-Tag Mobility Shift Assay (PTMSA) is developed for the in vivo detection of protein phosphorylation in plants by empirical optimization of methods previously developed for animals. Initially, the detection of the phosphorylation status of target proteins using protocols directly adapted from animals failed. Therefore, we optimized the steps in the protocol, from protein migration to the transfer of proteins to PVDF membrane. Supplementing the electrophoresis running buffer with 5 mM NaHSO3 solved most of the problems in protein migration and transfer. The optimization of a fast and robust protocol that efficiently detects the phosphorylation status of plant proteins was successful. This protocol will be a valuable tool for plant scientists interested in the study of protein phosphorylation.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",27,2018

Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to analyze the genetic diversity of micro-propagated and greenhouse grown M.26. Shoot proliferation was carried out in MS (Murashige and Skoog) containing benzyladenin (BA, 0.5 ~ 5.0 mg･L-1) and thidiazuron (TDZ, 0.01 ~ 0.1 mg･L-1). The highest number of shoots (10.67 shoots per explant) was induced by adding BA at a concentration 1.0 mg･L-1. TDZ treatments caused higher hyperhydricity rate in cultured explants than in BA treatments. There was no significant effect of both BA and auxin on shoot proliferation, and the optimum proliferation medium for M.26 was MS medium containing 1.0 mg･L-1 BA. To find a suitable medium composition for shoot rooting, we tested different concentrations indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) and α-naphthaleneacetic acid (0.5 ~ 5.0 mg･L-1), MS medium (1/4-1), sucrose (0 ~ 30 g･L-1). The shoots showed good rooting on half-strength MS medium containing 1.0 mg･L-1 IBA and 15-20 g･L-1 sucrose. The rooting rate (100%), number of roots (10.45 ~ 13.60 roots per explant), root length (7.41 ~ 8.33 cm), and shoot length (4.93 ~ 5.38 cm) were good on this medium. Fifteen SSR primers were detected in a total of 30 alleles in 20 micro-propagated plantlets, all SSR profiles from micro-propagated plantlets were monomorphic and similar to greenhouse grown control plantlet M.26 plant.

Owing to the seasonal and long-term agricultural cultivation methods of Korean ginseng, they are always vulnerable to various environmental stress conditions. ABSCISIC ACID (ABA) is an essential plant hormone associated with seed development and diverse abiotic stress responses including drought, cold and salinity stress. By modulating ABA responses, plants can regulate their immune responses and growth patterns to increase their ability to tolerate stress. With recent advances in genome sequencing technology, we first reported the functional features of genes related to canonical ABA signaling pathway in P. ginseng genome. Based on the protein sequences and functional genomic analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana, the ABA related genes were successfully identified. Our functional genomic characterizations clearly showed that the ABA signaling related genes consisting the ABA receptor proteins (PgPYLs), kinase family (PgSnRKs) and transcription factors (PgABFs, PgABI3s and PgABI5s) were evolutionary conserved in the P. ginseng genome. We confirmed that overexpressing ABA related genes of P. ginseng completely restored the ABA responses and stress tolerance in ABA defective Arabidopsis mutants. Finally, tissue and age specific spatio-temporal expression patterns of the identified ABA-related genes in P. ginseng tissues were also classified using various available RNA sequencing data. This study provides ABA signal transduction related genes and their functional genomic information related to the growth and development of Korean ginseng.

Treatment with Pro (10 mM) resulted in more accumulation of Pro (~2.6-fold) in Pro-treated spinaches compared to untreated ones. These Pro-pretreated spinaches were more freezing-tolerant, showing more turgid leaves and petioles compared to untreated controls. However, when spinaches pre-treated with or without Pro were subjected to freezing, there was no significant difference in overall amino acid contents, emphasizing the role of Pro as an osmo-protectant. Freezing stress prompted intensification of total amino acid contents irrespective of pretreatment with Pro. Asp, Glu, Ala, and Val were the most abundant free amino acids due to increased protein degradation and nitrogen mobilization for plant survival under freezing stress. Arg, a precursor for the synthesis of polyamines in plants, was profoundly enhanced under freezing stress. This implies that Arg plays an important role in modulating freezing tolerance. Gly, Leu, and Ile were maintained at relatively low levels in all treatments.

Historically, social security benefits were reduced if labor income exceeded a certain level. The employment tax ranged from a $1 reduction for each $1 earned to a $1 reduction for each $3 earned. Prior to 2000, the age at which this reduction was no longer applied, varied between 70 and 75. However, in 2000 the age was lowered to what the Social Security Administration calls the normal retirement age which ranges between 65 and 67 depending on the date the person was born. Such a major change provided fertile ground for economic research. Studies have proliferated on the impact of the regime change on the labor force participation rates of elderly males. However, little work has been conducted regarding the impact of this policy change on female labor force participation rates. This study shows that after the employment tax was eliminated for those reaching their normal retirement age, the labor-force participation rates of single, divorced, separated and widowed women in the targeted age range usually increased. The estimates indicate the labor-force participation rates of married women in the affected age range fell with the elimination of the employment tax.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",17,2018

Conventional propagation through seeds requires one to two years of breaking dormancy. The objective of this study was to determine the conditions of in vitro germination in C. retusus. In vitro embryo culture was carried out to investigate the effects of six factors: basal media (McCown Woody Plant Medium (WPM) and Murashige and Skoog (MS)); plant growth regulators (different combinations and concentrations of naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), 6-Benzylaminopurine (BA), and gibberellic acid (GA3)); embryo age (collected weekly beginning 36 days after fruit setting); low temperature pretreatment (storing 4°C for 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks); coconut additives (100, 200, and 300 ml·L-1); and genotype (grouping plants depending on their flowering nature). The basal medium used in this study was WPM with 2 mg·L-1-1 GA3, 20 g·L-1 sucrose, and 6 g·L-1 Agar. WPM medium mixed with GA3, resulted in higher germination rate as compared to when using a combination of auxin and cytokinin. GA3 at 2 mg·L-1 was the most effective of all combinations and concentrations of PGRs. WPM medium with 2 mg·L-1 GA3 resulted in better and faster germination (75.93%). Embryos collected at 57 days after fruit setting had the highest percent of germinated seeds (87.04%) while low-temperature pretreatment of fruits at 4°C for two weeks produced the highest germination (95.37%). These results of this study could be an open ground for development of an efficient protocol for commercial production of the ornamental tree.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",41,2018

This study aims to evaluate the conformity of the shin circumference measurement in living animals and in post‑mortem examinations, in order to evaluate the forensic reliability of these measurements. The right and left distal forelimbs from 11 horses of 5 different breeds were examined. The shin circumference was measured at 3 time points: in the living animal before slaughter/euthanasia, 5 hours post‑mortem, and after 14‑days of cold storage. The isolated limbs were also weighed in both of the post‑mortem examinations.

The results of odds ratio suggested that there are 2.18 time's higher chances of disease when body weight of buffaloes is less than 500 kg; 1.65 times in dry than lactating animals; 2.58 times when small ruminants are present; and 1.19 times when cattle are absent. The total positive buffaloes observed by Avian PPD were 12, although only 10 were then confirmed by ELISA, and 8 by ZN faecal microscopy. The relative sensitivity and specificity of Avian PPD by considering ELISA as standard test were 80.0% and 89.47%, respectively.

However, paucity of data is available for the performance of these treatments when used with a curative intent. The aim of this study is to investigate the local progression free-survival (LPFS) after radical percutaneous image-guided ablation of BM in oligometastatic patients, and to identify predictive factors associated with local tumor progression. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective review of all patients who underwent percutaneous image-guided CA or RFA of BM with a radical intent between 2007 and 2018. Results: Forty-six patients with a total of forty-nine BM underwent percutaneous image-guided CA (N = 37; 75,5%) or RFA (N = 12; 24,5%). Primary malignancies included thyroid (N = 11, 22.5%), breast (N = 21; 42.9%), lung (N = 8; 16.3%) and other (N = 9; 18,3%) cancers. Additional consolidation was performed after ablation in 20.4% cases (N = 10). Mean follow-up was 34.1 ± 22 months. Local progression at the treated site was observed in 28.5% cases (N = 14); 1- and 2-year LPFS was 76.8% and 71.7%, respectively. Size of BM (>2 cm) predicted local tumor progression (p =.002).

Results of injection test and analysis of wellbore breakouts were used to verify the accuracy of the stress profiles. In this study the Bartoon method, which using the breakout angle and strength of rock, was used. In addition, the ability of artificial neural network to estimate the elastic parameters of rock and stress field was used. The output of the neural network represents a high accuracy in the estimation of the desired parameters. In addition, the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion was used to verify stress profiles. Estimated stresses show relative compliance with the results of injection test and Barton method. The required minimum mud pressure for preventing shear failures was calculated by using the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion and the estimated stress profiles. The results showed a good compliance with failures which have been identified in the caliper and image logs. However, a number of noncompliance is observed in some depth. This is due to the concentration of fractures, collisions between the drill string and the wellbore wall, as well as swab and surge pressures. The stress mode is normal and strike-slip in some depth based on the estimated stress profiles. According to direction of breakouts which is clearly visible in the caliper and image logs, the minimum and maximum horizontal stresses directions were NW-SE and NE-SW, respectively. Thses directions were consistent with the direction of regional stresses in the Zagros belt.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",32,2018

Should it protect lies? Some argue that the state should intervene to prevent and punish lying because the people are insufficiently rational (they are too emotional, and, therefore vulnerable) or excessively rational (they find it too costly to investigate claims and are, therefore, vulnerable). Others retort that state officials are not neutral or objective, but have their own interests to advance and protect, and, therefore, cannot be trusted. Though certain kinds of lying, like fraud and perjury, are clearly not protected speech, courts have recently seemed sympathetic to the view that the proper response to lying is not government action, but the workings of the marketplace of ideas. The distinguished economist, Ronald Coase, has taken this argument much farther, applying it to commercial speech, but thus far his views have not prevailed.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",51,2018

The framework incorporates these aspects and proposes a suitable community-wide co-creation model employing the creative, innovative and cooperative applications of ICT. The assessment methodology is developed using a pragmatic mixed-method research design where the theoretical framework summarizes current research progress on the topic and the expert interviews allow to condense the complex and multi-dimensional realities for decision-makers seeking social innovations in the public spaces. The methodological assessment framework presented in this paper strengthens the scientific evidence regarding the potential of co-creation in developing social innovations and provides a managerial framework for developing co-creative initiatives.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",28,2018

In this regard, we intend to understand the behaviour of companies which have carried out reshoring strategies and their links with the territorial and regional area, and hence the economic resilience of the Italian regions in the face of most recent economic and financial shocks, which has contributed to these types of business and production choices. The aim is to demonstrate whether there is a relationship at regional level between companies which have made reshoring choices and the degree of economic resilience of an area.

A well-known relevant event in this domain was the signature of the Paris Agreement in 2014, and its subsequent enforcement by European Union (EU) member countries. This study examines if the climate change measures adopted by the Agreement had an impact on the electricity sector outside the EU28, seeking to assess whether there is international diversity in these markets or if they work uniformly at global level. The goal of this work is to study the behavior of spot electricity prices before and after the Agreement was signed by EU members, analyze its effect in terms of spot prices, and determine the conditions that lead to stability and non-stability. We examine the behavior of spot electricity prices in two different electricity markets: the US and Brazil. The study applies both qualitative methodologies, namely fsQCA, and quantitative methodology, in order to identify changes in the pattern of electricity price behavior with the advent of the Agreement. Arguably, regulatory theory still incorporates the effects of the emergence of global dynamics in the regulation process. However, what this article suggests is that changes in regulatory frameworks with global impact, even if exogenous to a specific market, can profoundly alter the dynamics of that market.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",40,2018

All rights reserved.There has been a numerous amount of economic research carried out which has aimed at identifying the factors that could contribute positively to economic growth. The economic literature available on this matter appears to acknowledge that entrepreneurship is one of the elements that could positively contribute to this growth. Among other factors, both entrepreneurship and knowledge are generally considered to play an important role regarding this macro-economic goal. Bearing this in mind, the positive bond that exists between both of them, which also contributes to economic growth and improvements in welfare, is increasingly analyzed in the different economic studies available. The goal of this paper is to empirically analyze the existing relationship between economic growth, knowledge and entrepreneurship within the context of Latin American countries during the period 2001-2016. For this purpose, the self-employment variable has been used as an empirical proxy of entrepreneurship. In general, the availability of reliable statistical information on entrepreneurship is quite limited especially in the case of the Latin American countries. Consequently, this is one of the reasons why there is a lack of unanimity as to the application of one dataset or another to measure entrepreneurship in the analysis. Therefore, although it is true that there is certain disagreement regarding the use of the aforementioned empirical proxy, there are, however, several references in favor of the use of self-employment statistics in the analysis of entrepreneurship. In order to do so, first of all we study the existing link between economic growth and certain determining factors such as public expenditure, investment, human capital, knowledge and entrepreneurship. Afterwards, we analyze the effects on entrepreneurship caused by such factors as, for example, unemployment, taxes and education (as a proxy of knowledge).","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",66,2018

Presently, companies mostly use traditional financial ratios to evaluate their financial performance.

Using Data Envelopment Analysis, we analyzed the efficiency of retail food companies in Hungary’s Northern Great Plain region from 2009 to 2014 using their financial reports. To improve the result of the performance measurement, we used the bootstrap method, the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulation, and Bayesian statistics. We transformed the primarily deterministic DEA method into a stochastic DEA model. The primary target of this extension is to enhance statistical inference in DEA and to integrate it with a stochastic mechanism of Bayesian techniques. To develop the stochastic DEA model, we use Stan Stochastic Modelling Language within the framework of the R Statistics. Analyzing the results, we can state that the DEA method can be used for analyzing efficiency, and the additions shown can make the evaluation much more accurate. We can conclude that the best results were produced by the combined method, during a simultaneous application of the input orientation.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",31,2018

Although financial institutions promote development, consumers have lost confidence in banks. As we enter the Fintech era, banks have the opportunity to use new tools that enable greater transparency for customers. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) plays a key role in increasing social awareness of regulators, society, shareholders, and employees—in short, stakeholders. This study therefore focuses on banks that have designed their activities and investments to contribute to sustainability. The principal contribution of this paper is to show the existence of a range of business models that arise following different responses by different types of banks. These different responses occur because the primary objective of sustainable banks is to meet the needs of stakeholders and contribute to sustainable development, whereas conventional banks simply apply and execute CSR policies. It is possible to differentiate between ethical banks and commercial banks. To ensure economic progress and achieve sustainability, it is fundamental to balance economic profitability with people’s social and environmental aspirations.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",84,2018

All Rights Reserved.Objective: Report our experience of the management of a patient with undiagnosed retroperitoneal paraganglioma and the intraoperative complications that the theatre team faced. Case report: We present a case of a 36-year-old patient who during oncological follow-up for a previous diagnosis of parotid acinar cell carcinoma was incidentally identified as having an interaortocaval tumour. Following routine preoperative assessment the patient was arranged to undergo a laparoscopic retroperitoneal tumour resection. After minimal tumour manipulation the patient developed cardiac rhythm abnormalities and became hypertensive. The tumour was successfully removed laparoscopically after a cautious inter- aortocaval dissection. Abruptly, prior to extraction of the tumour containing endobag, the patient developed cardiac arrest. Following 35 minutes of life support measures there was a return of spontaneous circulation. The endobag was laparoscopically removed from the abdominal cavity 24 hours later using the initial operative port sites. The patient´s progression was satisfactory and he could be discharged six days postoperatively. Conclusions: Asymptomatic undiagnosed paragangliomas represent a real challenge during laparoscopic operations. Haemodynamic changes and life-threatening events can arise acutely intraoperatively, where an immediate and coordinated response of the whole theatre team may be required to avoid fatal outcomes.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",3,2018

All Rights Reserved. Objective: A longitudinal prospective case control study was organized to explore the relationships between glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal resistive index (RRI) and blood pressure values in a non-dialysis dependent adult population affected by chronic kidney disease and exposed to low systolic blood pressure (SBP) values. Material and methods: The study sample (54 patients: 31 males and 23 females with an average age of 61.7 ± 19.2 years) was randomly selected from a population of adult non-dialysis dependent patients that scored a SBP < 100 mmHg at the medical examination. The patients were equally divided in two groups defined by the presence and absence of chronic kidney disease, (i.e. a GFR less or greater than 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2 , respectively). Patients were submitted to a full therapeutic and dietetic intervention to correct the hypotension until reaching a steady SBP > 100 mmHg. Results: In the group with chronic renal disease, the comparison between the data recorded with SBP < 100 mmHg (t0) and those detected with SBP ≥ 100 mmHg (t1) showed a statistically significant decrease of serum creatinine as well as an increase of GFR (mean serum creatinine t0 – serum creatinine t1: 0.194 ± 0.35, p < 0.01; mean GFR t0 – GFR t1: -4.615 ± 8.8, p < 0.013).

Introduction: Chronic prostatitis (CP)/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) represents a challenge for the urologist, since the therapeutic efficacy does not always result in a satisfactory quality of life for the patients. Often the side effects of the medications used (anti-inflammatories, antibiotics, alpha blockers) far outweighs the benefits gained with their admission. The choice of nutraceutical medications is preferred for their effectiveness, that has been accepted and proven by the scientific community, and for the low incidence of side effects. The objective of this study to compare the therapeutic efficacy of the flower pollen extracts (Deprox ® ) versus Bioflavonoids in terms of reduction of symptoms, and in the average waiting time of the variation of the National Institute of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI), and to evaluate the quality of life improvement of the patients affected by CP/CPPS. Methods: Among the 68 patients presented with prostatic symptoms to the Hospital “Umberto I” in Rome, Italy between March 2016 and June 2016, 54 patients met the clinical diagnosis of CP/CPPS (class IIIa or IIIb according to the NIH classification). The patients were assigned to either treatment with Deprox ® or quercetin based on a randomization scheme previously determined.The NIH- CPSI, IPSS, QoL questionnaires were administered. Every patient underwent bacterial cultures and trans-rectal ultrasound. Results: There was a statistically significant improvement of the NIH-CPSI score and QoL in the Deprox ® group (p = < 0.0001 and p = 0.003 respectively). The average waiting time of the variation of the National Institute of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) was statistically significant (p = 0.0019). In the absence of efficacy of the “conventional” medications, which also carries significant side effects, the dietary supplements may represent a valid alternative. Conclusions: DEPROX ® has demonstrated a significant improvement of the symptoms and quality of life of patients diagnosed with by CP/CPPS. Furthermore, there was a statistical difference in the average waiting time of the variation of the NIH-CPSI) score without side effects as compared to the bioflavonoids complex with quercetin.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",24,2018

All Rights Reserved.The modern clinical research on prostatitis started with the work of Stamey and coworkers who developed the basic principles we are still using. They established the segmented culture technique for localizing the infections in the males to the urethra, the bladder, or the prostate and to differentiate the main categories of prostatitis. Such categories with slight modifications are still used according to the NIH classification: acute bacterial prostatitis, chronic bacterial prostatitis, Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS) and asymptomatic prostatitis. Prostatic inflammation is considered an important factor in influencing both prostatic growth and progression of symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostatitis. Chronic inflammation/neuroinflammation is a result of a deregulated acute phase response of the innate immune system affecting surrounding neural tissue at molecular, structural and functional levels. Clinical observations suggest that chronic inflammation correlates with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CP/CPPS) and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and an history of clinical chronic prostatitis significantly increases the odds for prostate cancer. The NIH-NIDDK classification based on the use of the microbiological 4-glasses localization test or simplified 2-glasses test, is currently accepted worldwide. The UPOINT system identifies groups of clinicians with homogeneous clinical presentation and is used to recognize phenotypes to be submitted to specific treatments. The UPOINTS algorithm implemented the original UPOINT adding to the urinary domains (U), psycho-social (P), organ-specific (O), infection (I), neurological (N), muscle tension and tenderness (T) a further domain related to sexuality (S). In fact sexual dysfunction (erectile, ejaculatory, libido loss) has been described in 46-92% of cases with a high impact on the quality of life of patients with CP/CPPS. Prostatic ultrasound represents the most popular imaging test in the work-up of either acute and chronic prostatitis although no specific hypo-hyper-echoic pattern has been clearly associated with chronic bacterial prostatitis and CPPS. Use of a digital-processing software to calculate the extension of prostatic calcification area at ultrasound demonstrated a higher percentage of prostatic calcification in patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis. Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (mpMRI) is the current state-of-the art imaging modality in the assessment of patients with prostate cancer although a variety of benign conditions, including inflammation, may mimic prostate cancer and act as confounding factors in the discrimination between neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions. Bacteria can infect prostate gland by: ascending the urethra, reflux of urine into the prostatic ducts, direct inoculation of bacteria through inserted biopsy needles or hematogenous seeding. Enterobacteriaceae are the predominant pathogens in acute and chronic bacterial prostatitis, but an increasing role of Enterococci has been reported. Many strains of these uropathogens exhibit the ability to form biofilm and mul-tidrug-resistance. Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) agents, in particular Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium, have been also considered as causative pathogens of chronic bacterial prostatitis. On the contrary the effective role in genital diseases of other ""genital mycoplasmas"" is still a much debated issue. Sexually Transmitted Infections agents should be investigated by molecular methods in both patient and sexual partner. “Next generation” investigations, such as cytokine analysis, cytological typing of immune cells could help stratifying the immune response. Epigenetic dysregulation of inflammatory factors should be investigated according to systemic and compartment-specific signals. The search for biomarkers should also include evaluation of hormonal pathways, as measurement of estrogen levels in semen. Antimicrobials are the first line agents for the treatment of bacterial prostatitis. The success of antimicrobial treatment depends on the antibacterial activity and the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drug which must reach high concentrations in prostate secretion and prostate tissue. Acute bacterial prostatitis can be a serious infection with a potential risk for urosepsis For iInitial treatment of severely ill patients, intravenous administration of high doses of bactericidal antimicrobials, such as broad-spectrum penicillins, third-generation cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones, is recommended in combination with an aminoglycoside. Use of piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem is justified in presence of multiresistant gram-negative pathogens. The antibiotic treatment of chronic prostatitis is currently based on the use of fluoroquinolones that, given for 2 to 4 weeks, cured about 70% of men with chronic bacterial prostatitis. For the treatment of Chlamydial prostatitis macrolides were shown to be more effective than fluoroquinolones, whereas no differences were observed in microbiological and clinical efficacy between macrolides and tetracyclines for the treatment of infections caused by intracellular pathogens. Aminoglycosides and fosfomycin could be considered as a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of quinolone resistant prostatitis. Use of alpha-blockers in CP/CPPS patients with urinary symptoms and analgesics +/- non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), in presence of pain demonstrated a reduction of symptoms reduction and an improvement of quality of life, although long term use of NSAID is limited by side effect profile. However, the multimodal therapeutic regimen by contemporary use of alpha-blockers, antibiotics and anti-inflammatory showed a better control of prostatitis symptoms than single drug treatment. Novel therapeutic substances for the treatment of pain, such as the cannabinoid anandamide would be highly interesting to test. An alternative for the treatment of chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome is phytotherapy, as primary therapy or in association with other drugs. Quercetin, pollen extract, extract of Serenoa repens and other mixtures of herbal extracts showed a positive effect on symptoms and quality of life without side effects. The association of CP/CPPS with alterations of intestinal function has been described. Diet has its effects on inflammation by regulation of the composition of intestinal flora and direct action on the intestinal cells (sterile inflammation). Intestinal bacteria (microbiota) interacts with food influencing the metabolic, immune and inflammatory response of the organism. The intestinal microbiota has protective function against pathogenic bacteria, metabolic function by synthesis of vitamins, decomposition of bile acids and production of trophic factors (butyrate), and modulation of the intestinal immune system. The alteration of the microbiota is called “dysbiosis” causing invasive intestinal diseases pathologies (leaky gut syndrome and food intolerances, irritable bowel syndrome or chronic inflammatory bowel diseases) and correlating with numerous systemic diseases including acute and chronic prostatitis. Administration of live probiotics bacteria can be used to regulate the balance if intestinal flora. Sessions of hydrocolontherapy can represent an integration to this therapeutic approach. Finally, microbiological examination of sexual partners can offer supplementary information for treatment.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",117,2018

All Rights Reserved.Objective: Low-intensity shock-wave treatment (LiSWT) is a therapy for erectile dysfunction (ED) with good results reported in the literature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of LiSWT on patients treated for ED and the influence of ED duration in treatment outcomes. Material and methods: We performed an open-label single-arm prospective study of patients treated with LiSWT for ED. Patients were assessed with the IIEF-5 at baseline and at six weeks and three months after LiSWT, and with penile dynamic Doppler ultrasound before treatment and six weeks after. Patients were divided into two groups accordingly to ED evolution time: ≤ 24 months and > 24 months. Results: Twenty-five patients were enrolled, 13 had ED ≤ 24 months and 12 > 24 months. Median baseline IIEF-5 was 14, at 6 weeks post LiSWT was 16 (p < 0.001) and at 3 months post LiSWT was 18 (p < 0.001). Mean baseline peak systolic velocity (PSV) was 29.3 ± 13.0 cm/s, after LiSWT was 35.9 ± 15.2 cm/s (p 0.001). Mean baseline end-diastolic velocity (EDV) was 2.6 ± 4.8 cm/s and after LiSWT was 1.3 ± 4.3 cm/s (p 0.015). No statistical significative difference was identified between the two groups. Conclusions: LiSWT is a safe, harmless and repeatable treatment tool for ED with good outcomes reported. Our results suggest that length of disease duration doesn´t negatively influences treatment results.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2018

All Rights Reserved.Objective:To evaluate the diagnostic value of serum inflammation markers derived from complete blood count in diagnosis of prostate cancer (PCa). Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data of 621 patients who underwent prostate biopsy between March 2013 and April 2018. Age, prostate specific antigen (PSA), free PSA, platelet count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, monocyte count, prostate volume (PV) and pathology result of the patients were recorded. Patients were grouped as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostatitis and PCa. Patients were also grouped according to PSA values, as PSA < 4, PSA 4-10 and PSA > 10 ng/dl. Results: The mean lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) value of the patients with PCa was significantly lower in the entire cohort (p = 0.047). In the PSA 4-10 ng/dl range, LMR value wassignificantly lower in patients with PCa than those with BPH or prostatitis (p = 0.012). In this PSA range, free/total PSA ratio and LMR were significant factors to predict PCa. The cut-off values of LMR, free/total PSA were 3.05 and 0.15 respectively. The sensitivities, spesificities, positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values using LMR cut-off, free/total PSA cut-off and their combination were assessed. Specificity and PPV of the combination group were higher (97.2%, 83.3% respectively) compared to free/total PSA cut-off group (91.6%, 76.6%) and LMR cut-off group (67.8%, 43.7%). Conclusions: LMR is a useful tool at detecting PCa especially in patients with PSA value between 4 and 10 ng/dl. The combination of free/total PSA ratio and LMR improves the diagnostic accuracy more than the use of free/total PSA ratio alone.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2018

All Rights Reserved.Objective: Retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) is still widely used in clinical practice in localized prostate cancer because of its high oncological success. The aim of this study was to define the continence status in patients where rhabdosphincter was included in the vesicourethral anastomosis. Materials and methods: Between November 2004 and September 2010, 90 cases who underwent RRP by the same surgeon in our clinic were taken into the study. In all cases vesicourethral anastomosis was performed include the rhabdosphincter. The anastomosis was performed with mean 2.9 (0-7) interrupted no 2-0 vicryl sutures, depending on the angu-lation of symphysis pubis and pelvic cavity. Pad test was performed to all patients at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. We defined patients as ‘continent’ when they no need pad, as ‘mild incontinence’ when they use only one pad daily, as ‘moderate incontinence’ when they use two or three pads daily and as ‘severe incontinence’ when they use more than three pads daily. Results: Preoperative total PSA value was 12.2 ng/ml (range: 2.7-84 ng/ml). Preoperative prostate biopsy results were found that Gleason scores were 5, 6, 7 and 8 in 7, 53, 21, 9 patients, respectively. Mean operation and urethral catheter removal time was 103 minutes (60-200) and 14,6 days (9-28), respectively. Mean hospital stay was 4.6 days (2-20). According to results of postoperative pad tests, 38 (42.2%), 48 (53.3%), 55 (61.1%) and 75 (83.3%) patients were defined as continent in first, third, sixth and twelfth months, respectively. Conclusions: We think that, our novel technique of vesicourethral anastomosis in standard RRP provides more optimal urethral position during fixation of pelvic floor and urethra, protect caudal retraction, preserve functional urethral length. Also strong full thickness stitch on urethra provides better urinary continence by hanging urethra in our patients. Although our early continence rate is better, our long term continence rate is similar to literature.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",24,2018

All Rights Reserved.Objectives: We conducted this study to evaluate patients with retained encrusted ureteral stents, identify the predisposing factors and present our experience in the management of such challenging problem. Materials and Methods: This prospective study was carried out in the period from May 2007 to February 2011 at the Urology and Nephrology Center, Al-Thawra General Hospital, Sana’a, Yemen. 40 patients with retained encrusted ureteric stents were treated at our center. All patients were initially evaluated with a radiographic imaging for assessment of stent encrustation and stone burden. Treatment decisions were based on the site and severity of encrustations in the renal pelvis, ureter and bladder and on our technical situation and availability of instrumentations. Multi-modal approaches ranging from extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) to endourological and open urologic procedures were used to achieve stent removal. Results: A total of 90 urological procedures were performed to render all 40 patients stent and stone free. The average duration of stent remained indwelling was 24.2 months (range 4 months -16 years). All patients were managed either by minimally or more invasive multi-modal endourological approaches. For upper coil encrustation percutaneous nephrolithotripsy was performed in eight patients, pyelolithotomy in two patients and ESWL in three patients. Encrustation of the body was treated initially by ESWL, followed by retrograde ureteroscopic manipulation in 12 patients. Lower coil encrustation was successfully managed by cystolitholapaxy in seven patients and one patient required cystolithotomy. Cystolithotomy, pyelolithotomy and ureterolithotomy were carried out in two patients. Two patients who had large burden bladder and kidney stones with loss of kidney function underwent nephrectomy and cystolithotomy. Conclusions: The retrieval of severely encrusted retained ureteral stent and its associated stone burden poses a real management challenge for urologists due to the need for multimodal procedures and the lack of standardized treatment plan.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2018

All Rights Reserved.Objective: the aim of our study was to put forward insights to treat any possible correlation among sperm quality, sperm DNA damage and male age as they may have fertility implications for men who choose to delay fatherhood. Materials and methods: Our study is a non-interventional retrospective analysis of 3124 semen samples from patients that were investigated for the conventional semen parameters. Tunel test assay was set up for the evaluation of the sperm DNA fragmentation index (DFI). We applied the Kappa index to compare both the 1999 and the 2010 World Health Organization (WHO) reference criteria to evaluate the competence of such semen parameters categorization during the standard routine of our laboratory. Results: With regards to our findings, it is possible to underline a significant relationship between aging and semen volume (p = 0.001), motility (p = 0.009), semen viscosity (p < 0.003) and sperm DNA damage (p < 0.009). We found a trend when focusing on the semen concentration (p = 0.05). The analysis of sperm morphology did not show any influence with advancing age (p = 0.606). When comparing both the 1999 and the 2010 WHO scales we found no accordance in the appraisal of sperm morphology but a very good one in the evaluation of the other parameters. Conclusions: Conventional semen analysis represents the opportunity to draw up a proxy insight on the male fertility status even if semen quality can only indirectly assess the probability of pregnancy. Several studies have verified a decay in the male reproductive system, sperm quality and fertility with advancing age although the reported results are not yet conclusive. Our results substantially agree with those findings outlined in the literature. Moreover we find that the discrepancy between the two WHO reference scales would eventually lead to an improper diagnosis of infertility.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",21,2018

However, still the literature is missing with the effect of economic indicators on supply chain performance, particularly in fishing industry. Therefore, the objective of the current study is to examine the role of economic indicators on supply chain performance in fishing industry of Indonesia. Economic indicators such as interest rate, inflation rate and human development index (HDI) has relationship with supply chain performance. Increases or decrease in interest and inflation has direct effect on the supply of fish products which ultimately influence the whole supply chain performance. Fishing industry is one of the industries which is working from many centuries and now growing rapidly and considered to be the important element of economic growth in different countries like Indonesia. Six hypotheses were formulated with the help of previous studies, concerning the relationship between inflation rate, interest rate, human development index (HDI), gross domestic product (GDP) and supply chain performance. GDP was considered as the mediating variable. Managerial employees of fishing companies were selected as the respondents of this study. Primary data was collected by conducting the questionnaire survey. Total number of one hundred and ninety-six (196) responses was received. These responses were analysed with the help of statistical software namely; Partial Least Square (PLS). It was found that economic indicators have influence on supply chain performance. Increases in inflation rate and interest rate decreases the supply chain performance. However, increases in HDI enhances the GDP and promote supply chain performance. Additionally, GDP is a mediating variable between HDI and supply chain which positively enhances the supply chain performance through HDI. Thus, study provides the clues for government to promote supply chain performance by controlling inflation and interest rate.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",54,2018

All rights reserved.This study analyses a unique aspect of the speed of adjustment to optimal debt levels in an emerging market by accounting for the impact of State Affiliated Directors (SAD) on internal governance mechanisms. The paper is motivated based view where firms adjust to reach an optimal level of debt ratio as well as the agency problem arising from the separation of ownership and control leading to conflicting interests between managers and shareholders in order to maximize firm value, which could ultimately impede shareholders wealth maximization. Furthermore, the potential for conflict between controlling and minority shareholders are also captured in the appointment of directors linked to the state. The authors, therefore, evaluate the presence of state affiliated directors and their potential to compromise board independence, which may lead to sub-optimal financing decisions. Analyzing firms below target levels, the study finds that the presence of SAD allows firms below target levels to adjust at more rapid rates given the potential for favorable treatment while obtaining credit financing from financial institutions. Contrastingly, the findings, however, show that firms which exceed target leverage levels tend to adjust at more rapid rates in the absence of SAD on boards. The study results point towards the reluctance of these firms to raise financing in equity markets given the possible dilution of ownership of controlling shareholders as well as the reluctance to reduce debt levels. The findings are consistent regardless of measuring debt based on book or market values and across randomized measures of board composition implying that the presence of SAD alters the dynamics of the cost of capital and thus managerial financing decisions.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",80,2018

This article aims to reveal who innovates in the organization by analyzing typical personality traits. The hypotheses are tested through a sample of 200 employees of public universities located in South Kalimantan, Indonesia, and structural equation modeling is used. Applying Hogan Personality Inventory (HPI), the five-factor personality in this research is labeled as adjustment (neuroticism), sociability (extraversion), likeability (agreeableness), prudence (conscientiousness), and school success (openness to experience). The results are discussed regarding the implications for what one can learn from individual-level studies of personality and innovation. Suggestions are offered to those universities interested in encouraging service quality in the public sector via innovation.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",40,2018

All rights reserved.The Social media represents, without a doubt, the most important avenue of communication on the modern Internet and the foremost tool of Web 2.0 technology. Its roots can be found in the ancient groupware technology, but its modern applications are beyond anything those users of old could have imagined. In recent years, it has morphed yet again, incorporating the prevalent new mobile technology as its delivery mechanism. The term “social media”, coined by Chris Shipley, includes the sum of the online tools and utilities that allow communication, participation and collaboration, including blogs and micro-blogs, social networking sites, wikis, podcasts and videocasts, social bookmarking and virtual worlds. At the end of 2015, over 2 billion users worldwide could access social media accounts and interact with one another on mobile phones, thus generating a wealth of data to be mined by marketers all over the world. However, this unprecedented access to consumer data (in conjunction with multiple user connections) has raised a number of privacy concerns, which have only grown in the last few years. This paper, detailing a study conducted for over a year on a wide variety of subjects, aims at interdisciplinary development of a clustering model based on both usage and perception variables, coupled with various psychographic predictor items, such as users’ attitude towards social media, users’ utilitarian and hedonic motivation, normative beliefs, perceived self-efficacy, various lifestyle variables, as well as overall trust and perception of privacy-associated risks. The proposed model is developed using discriminant analysis and it allows us to put forward four different user groups in terms of privacy concerns over social media. The management implications of our findings are also discussed and innovative ways proposed to deal with the ethical issues associated with the ever-growing lack of online privacy.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",31,2018

The analysis of the data received from 1108 representatives showed that although the willingness to cooperate in order to protect common interests is expressed by every second person, only a tenth of farmers participate in agricultural organizations. Higher intention to cooperate is expressed by middle-aged and better educated farmers rather than the youngest and the oldest as well as less educated representatives. In addition, men are keener on cooperating than women. It was also observed that stakeholder's initiative is related to the size and economic turnover of the farm. Statistical non-parametric tests and regression analysis on the sample allow to conclude that stakeholder participation in policy making in agriculture is insufficient in the case of Lithuania, therefore, institutional, procedural and managerial mechanisms are needed to balance the involvement of all stakeholder groups in to activities of common interests.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",37,2018

The paper concentrates on artistic collaborations and on collaborations with art heritage in cases where an artist has passed away but their paintings inspire designers and become interpreted and implemented into a luxury brand. These collaborations bring strong emotional and symbolic values for consumers as e.g. aesthetic pleasure, as well as feelings of being an art connoisseur and a part of global cultural elite. Moreover, luxury items with visual artistic elements (LIVAE) can provoke an interest in the arts and create educational value for people. The study was carried out in Moscow and the primary data was collected during March-April 2018 using online in-depth interviews with members of Facebook and Instagram communities devoted to luxury brands. The conducted research allowed the author to find out about the awareness of LIVAE and reveal the motives for their consumption among Muscovites such as 1) expressing individuality and demonstrating understanding and proximity to art and 2) getting an aesthetic pleasure for self. These motives form the two following segments of LIVAE consumers: 1) attention and differentiation seeking individualities and 2) aesthetic connoisseurs.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",25,2018

The aim of the paper is to determine whether in a specific Euroregion environment, cooperating public institutions and non-governmental organizations are affected by similar or different catalysts for the development of cross-border cooperation. Based on the literature review as well as desk research analyze, the theoretical part of the paper presents three key sets of catalysts for the development of cross-border cooperation, related to: the adopted model of cooperation; cooperating organizations; implemented cross-border activities. In order to solve the paper’s research problem the qualitative research were conducted. The co-authors analysed the results of focus group interviews and a survey conducted on a group of 100 Polish and Czech respondents developing cross-border cooperation in the Polish and Czech part of the Beskidy Euroregion were used. The sets of catalysts: “the model of cooperation”, “the resources and potential of partners” refer in a universal way to the processes of development of cross-border cooperation, while the third set-joint activities of partners is strongly correlated with Euroregional determinants. The analysis confirms that for nongovernmental organizations the strong catalysts for the development of cross-border cooperation are the resources and potentials of the cooperating organizations and joint activities of the partners, while the set including the cooperation model is not important. On the other hand, in the case of public institutions, the cooperation model and the resources and potentials of cooperating organizations can be considered weak catalysts, while the set including joint activities of partners is not important.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",25,2018

The contact angles of water and hexadecane on these patterns were measured, and the wear resistance of each pattern was evaluated by reciprocating wear tests. The taro pattern showed a significantly higher contact angle for hexadecane and a lower coefficient of friction than the lotus pattern. The taro pattern ridges are supposed to contain air in the valleys between the ridges and pillars, which prevented sticking between the pillars and cloth fibers. Thus, the taro pattern exhibits better oleophobicity and a lower frictional force.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",12,2018

This approach makes use of the grey systems concept and properties of grey numbers. The following three cost-based parameters were used as assessment criteria of the particular elements of the system in terms of improvements: meeting requirements, performance costs, and performance time. This approach was verified in a furniture manufacturing company, based upon the work health and safety management system according to PN-N 18001, which was in place in this company. By using the proposed approach, it was possible to rank all the assessed elements of the system, and to identify those elements that could be improved in the first sequence, taking into account the adopted assessment criteria.

The objective is to improve the pressure and velocity distribution inside the FDB. In this paper, the current spiral design has 12 number of grooves while the modified spiral design has 24 number of grooves. Both design can be classified into two, bearing with seal and without seal. Air was chosen to replace the oil as the lubricant. Results show that the modified spiral bearing design has comparable characteristics compared to conventional spiral design in terms of pressure and velocity distribution. Modified spiral geometries also shows a tendency to replace the function of seals in FDB.

All rights reserved.The concepts of good governance and effective government have been at the top of the public management agenda over the last decade. Good governance is seen as a central factor in growth and development. The aim of this paper was to analyse the relationships between effective government and predicting variables including GDP per capita, HDI, government spending, accountability, corruption control, political stability and rule of law. A quantitative econometric modelling methodology was utilized for the determination of long and short-run relationships using an ARDL model. Although a long-run relationship was established, of more importance was the short-run causality relationship. It was found that in most cases, effective governance causes changes in the other variables in the model. Effective government leads to strong public institutions. The results of this study, as well as the literature review, indicate effective government plays an important role in economic growth and development.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",53,2018

The investigated options include a smooth roller, a roller with a v-grooved surface, and a roller with holes under varying web tension and air temperature. The slippage phenomenon is a serious problem in the manufacturing of thin films, because it prevents continuous production and associated costs will increase. Therefore, the roller should be modified in order to mitigate the effects of slippage. To study the modified roller surface, an experimental apparatus was designed. The driving roller was modified to add holes, and an acrylic chamber covered the experimental apparatus to control air temperature. The specific web examined in this study was Polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The experiment showed that the roller with holes is an effective alternative for reducing slippage of web. The air temperature also greatly affected slippage of the web. When the air temperature increased above the ambient temperature of 60 degrees celsius, the operating web speed needed to be decreased in order to eliminate slipping.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",13,2018

When talking about differences among social groups and categories, a particular sub-type of body-directed gestural practice was salient: using indexical-iconic self-directed gestures as a way to describe other people’s physical bodies or appearances, including references to skin color, hair texture, clothing and ornamentation, and embodiments of carrying objects close to the body.

This raises the question to what extent variation in gesture environment may lead to related variation across sign languages, or, mutatis mutandis, to what extent similarities in gesture environment may lead to similarities across (otherwise unrelated) sign languages. This article will address that question by reviewing a series of studies relating to size and shape specifying (SASS) signs and gestures in signed and spoken languages in West Africa. The review finds that the use of body-based SASS gestures coincides with the use of body-based SASS signs in the sign languages studied, which in turn aligns with (a) restrictions on the number and types of handshapes used in space-based SASS signs, (b) limited use of space-based size depiction in lexical items (Nyst, 2018), and (c) a gap in the repertoire of phonemic handshapes. I conclude that culture-specific patterning in gesture environment may impact on cross-linguistic variation in SASS morphology and handshape phonology. As such, the gestural environment presents an explanation why SLs may be alike or different, in addition to shared ancestry, language contact, and iconicity.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",37,2019

More than a hundred years later, there is a considerable body of work describing human gestural diversity across languages and cultures. However, the question of communicative culture in our closest living relatives, the nonhuman primates, is relatively unexplored. Here, we will stir new interest into this topic by (i) briefly summarizing the current knowledge of animal culture, and (ii) presenting the current knowledge on gesture cultures, diversity and usage in the most common model for early hominid behaviour, the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). We will focus particularly on well-established behaviours being customary in some and absent in other chimpanzee communities, and recently discovered social customs that have been suggested to differ in their form, and/or meaning across populations. We also introduce latest findings on chimpanzees’ gestural diversity, providing further evidence for the role social negotiation plays in gestural acquisition. We conclude that the field has been hampered by misconstruing great ape gestures as fixed action patterns, a strong research bias on the perspective of signalers, and a lack of coherent methodology to assess the meaning and context of gestures across sites. We argue for systematic cross-site comparisons by viewing communicative exchanges as negotiations, enabling a unique perspective onto the evolutionary trajectory of culture and communication.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",108,2019

The algorithm is based on the single-stage target detection network YOLOv3, which simplifies the processing flow and significantly improves the detection accuracy.

Interlingual respeaking is a hybrid form of subtitling and interpreting and calls upon skills used in both professions. To consolidate this mode of audiovisual translation (AVT) within media accessibility (MA), a programme must be created to train future interlingual respeakers. This paper presents the results of the first ever study on interlingual respeaking, in which 10 participants interlingually respoke three short videos using a language combination of English and Spanish. The main areas of research in this project are feasibility, quality and training. Before expanding training in this area, interlingual respeaking must be deemed feasible and an effective method of assessment must be in place to determine its quality. The NTR model is a quality assessment model for interlingual live subtitles, of which an accuracy rate of 98% or above indicates acceptable live subtitles. The average accuracy rate of the study is 97.37%, with the highest accuracy rate reaching the 98% threshold with 98.50%.

We argue that these two apparently conflicting aspects of the relationship between information and linguistic meaning can be unified by showing that information conserves linguistic meaning, only insofar as computations of a certain kind are defined on the symbolic elements of a lexicon.

According to this view, sensory experiences would translate into concepts thanks to the recognition, correlation and integration of physical attributes. Once attributes are integrated into general patterns, subjects would become able to parse objects into categories. In this article, we critically review the three epistemological perspectives according to which it can be claimed that object concepts depend on perception: state non-conceptualism, content non-conceptualism, and content conceptualism. We show that the three perspectives have problems that make perception inadequate as a conceptual basis. We suggest that the inquiry about the origin and development of object concepts can benefit from a pragmatic perspective that considers objects' cultural functions as a conceptual foundation. We address this possibility from the theoretical framework of the pragmatics of the object, considering the importance of objects' functional permanence.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",192,2019

Results showed that Chinese Buddhists could represent time spatially corresponding to left-to-right, right-to-left and top-tobottom orientations in their religious scripts. Specifically, they associated earlier events with the starting point of the reading and later times with the endpoint. We also found that Chinese Buddhists were more likely to represent time in a clockwise way than Chinese atheists. This is because Buddhism regards time as cyclic and consisting of repeating ages (i.e. Wheel of Time).

They are pervasive in everyday language as an important aspect of ongoing language processing and meaning construction (Hamawand 2016). The application of Mental Space Theory (MST) to the analysis of real, attested examples of discourse (e.g. Conversation Analysis) has been undertaken through productive exchanges (see Hougaard 2004, 2005, Oakley & Hougaard 2008, Oakley 2009). The integration links external, observable language behaviors to internal, conceptual mental operations (Williams 2008), revealing that the cognitive dimensions of discursive approaches are essential to the analysis of talk-in-interaction. This study focuses on the technical aspects of Conversation Analysis in interactive academic talk and shows how MST can provide a subsequent framework for making plausible accounts of the meaning construction process underlying typical conversational moves in this unique talk setting. The data analyses show that the accessibility and selectivity of cognitive mappings contribute to shaping the structurality of meaning representation, transmission, and interpretation. The findings have implications for understanding and characterizing how co-constructed meaning enters into individual and collective conceptualization in higher education communication.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",108,2019

Our linguistic analysis did not only reveal that the differences should be taken seriously, but also that it seems to be possible to trace them back to different perspectives involved: The Anglo-American culture has an idea-based perspective, while the Mandarin Chinese culture has an image-based perspective to what appears to be a common basis for both Americans and Chinese in all other respects. The difference in perspective is, for instance, reflected in the two very different writing systems.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",87,2019

Therefore, this study applies the European guidelines and proposes different passive renovation measures in envelopes for representative building typologies in Spain: a building between party walls in a historic district and an apartment building, located in five different climatic zones. The study relates energy consumption and demand (kW•h/m2 year) and global cost (€) for different proposals, and determines optimal cost values and amortization periods. In addition, it proposes the cost30 indicator as the appropriate cost that enables amortization periods of less than 30 years; furthermore, the analysis is broadened by considering minimum wage in the investment. The results conclude that suitable values may be obtained with the optimal cost methodology, and that there are a variety of different valid renovation measures that depend mainly on typology, climatic zone and investment costs.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",34,2019

Further distribution of this work must maintain attribution to the author(s) and the published article's title, journal citation, and DOI.We introduce a new class of solutions to the Laplace equation, dubbed logopoles, and use them to derive a new relation between solutions in prolate spheroidal and spherical coordinates. The main novelty is that it involves spherical harmonics of the second kind, which have rarely been considered in physical problems because they are singular on the entire z axis. Logopoles, in contrast, have a finite line singularity like solid spheroidal harmonics, but are also closely related to solid spherical harmonics and can be viewed as an extension of the standard multipole ladder toward the negative multipolar orders. As part of our derivations, we also found a new integral representation for the spherical harmonics of the second kind in terms of their source distributions. As an example application, we use logopoles to construct a fast converging series solution for the problem of a point charge interaction with a dielectric sphere, which extends the basic image approximations introduced by Kelvin, Kirkwood, and Friedman. We believe these new solutions will prove a fruitful alternative to either spherical or spheroidal harmonics in a wide range of other physical problems.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",35,2019

Yet, as sea levels are projected to rise, relocating is an inevitable response for vulnerable coastal communities worldwide. In fact, some Fijian villages are facing such severe coastal erosion that they have already begun the process of shifting to higher ground, and many more villages throughout the islands have been slated for relocation. This case study is based on the planned relocation efforts of Narikoso village on Ono Island in Kadavu, Fiji. In Narikoso, regional NGOs, INGOs, and local and national government are working with the community to relocate the village inland. The process of moving the community began in 2012 when Prime Minister Bainimarama sent the Fiji military to Ono Island to clear land for the new village. It came to an abrupt stop due to a lack of funding and ecological degradation caused by the preparation for the new village site. Since the relocation process began, a myriad of issues have arisen ranging from concerns regarding community engagement, availability of financial resources, and resistance to moving inland.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",23,2019

More than 70% of what is consumed in this country is classified as carioca beans, based on seed qualities and appearance. We evaluated progenies of carioca common beans of the Brazilian agriculture research agency (Embrapa) recurrent selection program. This recurrent selection program is based on resistance to common bean bacterial blight (CBB), seed yield, and other important agronomic traits. Selection also considers the genetic representativeness of the parents and the genetic diversity among phenotypically selected progenies. Initially, 60 superior progenies were selected based on resistance to CBB and on seed type, in two locations (Santo Antônio de Goiás, GO and Ponta Grossa, PR). These progenies were evaluated in the C0S0:2 generation in field trials in six locations during the rainy growing season. A randomized block experimental design was used with two replications, in plots of two 3-m rows spaced at 0.5 m. The most promising C0S0:3 progenies for combined agronomic performance in the different environments were selected and were then evaluated by means of 24 microsatellite molecular markers for the purpose of determining the genetic representativeness of their parents and the genetic diversity among them. The phenotypic data was subjected to analysis of variance for each trait in each of the environments, and then joint analyses were performed. To estimate genetic diversity among the progenies, the Rogers-W genetic distance was used, and a dissimilarity matrix was used to construct a dendrogram of genetic distances through the UPGMA method. Among the 60 C0S0:2 progenies that were evaluated, those that stood out for resistance to CBB also stood out for seed yield and for resistance to other diseases. Various progenies were superior, exhibiting large genetic distances between each other and in relation to the parents. This indicates a possibility of direct and indirect gains from the recurrent selection program. This molecular information will help direct selection of individuals for future recombination cycles.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",47,2019

All rights reserved.Cement–asbestos slate is the main asbestos containing material. It is a product made by combining 10~20% of asbestos and cement components. Man- and weathering-induced degradation of the cement–asbestos slates makes them a source of dispersion of asbestos fibres and represents a priority cause of concern. When the asbestos enters the human body, it causes cellular damage or deformation, and is not discharged well in vitro, and has been proven to cause diseases such as lung cancer, asbestos, malignant mesothelioma and pleural thickening. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has designated asbestos as a group 1 carcinogen. Currently, most of these slats are disposed in a designated landfill, but the landfill capacity is approaching its limit, and there is a potential risk of exposure to the external environment even if it is land-filled. Therefore, this study aimed to exam the possibility of detoxification of asbestos-containing slate by using exothermic reaction and heat treatment. Cement–asbestos slate from the asbestos removal site was used for this experiment. Exothermic catalysts such as calcium chloride(CaCl2), magnesium chloride(MgCl2), sodium hydroxide(NaOH), sodium silicate(Na2SiO3), kaolin[Al2Si2O5(OH)4)], and talc[Mg3Si4O10(OH)2] were used. Six catalysts were applied to the cement–asbestos slate, respectively and then analyzed using TG-DTA. Based on the TG-DTA results, the heat treatment temperature for cement–asbestos slate transformation was determined at 750oC. XRD, SEM-EDS and TEM-EDS analyses were performed on the samples after the six catalysts applied to the slate and heat-treated at 750oC for 2 hours. It was confirmed that chrysotile[Mg3Si2O5(OH5)] in the cement–asbestos slate was transformed into forsterite (Mg2SiO4) by catalysts and heat treatment. In addition, the change in the shape of minerals was observed by applying a physical force to the slate and the heat treated slate after coating catalysts. As a result, the chrysotile in the cement–asbestos slate maintained fibrous form, but the cement–asbestos slate after heat treatment of applying catalyst was broken into non-fibrous form. Therefore, this study shows the possibility to safely verify the complete transformation of asbestos minerals in this catalyst- and temperature-induced process.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",9,2019

All rights reserved.Background: The mammalian target of the rapamycin inhibitor has dual inhibitory effects on cell growth and angiogenesis. This study aimed to analyze the usage of everolimus on actual immunosuppression (IS) regimens through a cross-sectional study in a high-volume liver transplantation (LT) center. Methods: Our institutional LT database was searched for adult patients who underwent primary LT surgery between January 2010 and December 2016. We identified 2,093 LT recipients with observation periods of 1 to 8 years. Results: We divided the 2,093 recipients into three groups according to the posttransplant follow-up period as follows: Group A (12-36 months; n=680), group B (37-60 months; n=560), and group C (>60 months; n=853). The individual IS agents were tacrolimus in 1,807 patients (86.3%), cyclosporine in 169 patients (8.1%), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in 1,310 patients (62.6%), and everolimus in 115 patients (5.5%). The most common IS regimens were tacrolimus-MMF combination and tacrolimus monotherapy, regardless of the posttransplant period. Patients with pretransplant malignancies were administered everolimus more frequently than those without pretransplant malignancies (P<0.001). In 102 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence or de novo malignancies, IS regimens included everolimus-tacrolimus in 41 patients (40.2%), tacrolimus-MMF in 27 patients (26.4%), tacrolimus in 20 patients (19.6%), MMF in 10 patients (9.8%), cyclosporine in three patients (2.9%), and cyclosporine-MMF in one patient (1.0%). Conclusions: Administration of everolimus after LT has been gradually increasing with the expansion of indications in our institutional practice. Currently, the role of everolimus is minimal and not comparable to that of tacrolimus, but it has a unique position in the field of IS after LT.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",24,2019

Quarterly Journal of Economics and Economic Policy,"[('Uniwersytet w Bialymstoku', 'Bialystok', 'Poland')]","© Institute of Economic Research.Research background: Independent fiscal councils are an example of new fiscal institutions, the number of which has rapidly increased around the world, including the EU countries since the global financial crisis of 2008–09. A further deterioration of public finance has provoked many economists to intensify disputes regarding the optimal shape, functions and effectiveness of fiscal councils responsible for promoting sound fiscal policy. Given this, a research focus on independent fiscal councils, active in the public debate in Europe, seems intellectually attractive. Purpose of the article: This article aims to explore the impact of Independent Fiscal Councils on fiscal performance, paying particular attention to their mandate, tasks and institutional models which can strengthen the achievement of fiscal discipline in the EU countries. In connection with this, the question arises about the effectiveness of fiscal councils, especially in the case of institutions that were compulsorily created under the external pressure (at the European level) and found no strong political support in national parliaments. Methods: Descriptive analysis along with panel data analysis were implemented to show the role of fiscal councils in enhancing fiscal discipline in the EU countries in years 2006–17 on the basis of data collected by the European Commission. Findings & Value added: The improvement in fiscal performance and better macroeconomic and budgetary forecasts can be achieved thanks to well-designed fiscal councils supported by appropriate fiscal rules. The conducted analysis confirms that independent fiscal councils are the useful mechanism introducing indirect social control over government revenues and expenditures. This means greater fiscal transparency and lower fiscal illusion between the government and the electorate. Due to the increase in the transparency of public finance, it is possible to reduce the ‘partisan’ deficit bias that contributes to public debt growth. The empirical research extends the existing knowledge on the role of fiscal councils and their impact on fiscal performance.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",47,2019

Vernal pools in the northeastern US are seasonal, small wetlands that provide critical breeding habitat for amphibians and invertebrates adapted to temporary waters, and are exceptionally hard to conserve as their function is dependent on connections to other wetlands and upland forests. A team of researchers in Maine joined forces with a diverse array of governmental and private stakeholders to develop an alternative to existing top-down vernal pool regulation. Through creative adoption and revision of various resource management tools, they produced a vernal pool conservation mechanism, the Maine Vernal Pool Special Management Area Plan that meets the needs of diverse stakeholders from developers to ecologists. This voluntary mitigation tool uses fees from impacts to vernal pools in locally identified growth areas to fund conservation of “poolscapes” (pools plus appropriate adjacent habitat) in areas locally designated for rural use. In this case study, we identify six key features of this mechanism that illustrate the use of existing tools to balance growth and pool conservation. This case study will provide readers with key concepts that can be applied to any conservation problem: namely, how to work with diverse interests toward a common goal, how to evaluate and use existing policy tools in new ways, and how to approach solutions to sticky problems through a willingness to accept uncertainty and risk.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2019

However, because these policy tools are state-driven, the technologies and fuel types included in each state's RPS vary. In this article, I discuss the inclusion of municipal solid waste in Maryland's RPS, and a social movement for environmental justice that has emerged around this decision. Given the prominence of RPSs in both fueling renewable energy adoption in the U.S., as well as in encouraging particular technologies, it is increasingly important to interrogate the types of technologies and fuel sources that climate policies like RPSs incentivize, and how they are received by the communities for which they are proposed.

Our research question was, “Do VR game-lab simulations lead to an increase in a) student knowledge of DNA-based technology, b) intrinsic motivation to study key biological concepts, and c) self-efficacy in an introductory biology course?” In our study conducted at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, the freshmore (ages between 19-22) cohorts were randomly divided into three groups, control (n = 180 students), VR game-lab simulations experienced on a laptop (desktop VR, n = 180 students) and experienced using a headset (immersive VR, n = 90 students). The classes assigned to the control group were taught using the prior method (PowerPoint slides/chalk and talk). The biological concept covered was consistent in all groups and was the polymerase chain reaction taught using a crime scene investigation scenario. Data collected showed that the desktop VR group of students achieved the greatest improvement in quiz scores after the simulation as compared to controls and immersive VR. This correlated with the significantly reduced response times taken for quizzes too for the desktop VR group. This may be attributed to the fact that the desktop VR was a longer simulation, with in depth theoretical wikis and descriptions of relevant theory.

To observe and exploit their extraordinary properties, we need to be able to properly manipulate them, for instance by braiding a couple of them in real space. We propose a setup based on the helical edges of two-dimensional topological insulators (2DTIs) that allows for a high degree of tunability by only controlling a handful of superconducting phases. In particular, our setup allows us to move the Majoranas along a single edge and to move them across two different edges coupled by a quantum point contact. Robustness against nonoptimal control of the phases is also discussed. This proposal constitutes an essential step forward toward realizing 2DTI-based architectures capable of performing braiding of Majoranas in a feasible way.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",61,2019

The 16S rRNA sequencing of a stressed microbial community in soil adjacent to the Qinghai-Tibet Highway (QTH) revealed that the accumulation of heavy metals (over about 10 years) has affected the diversity of bacterial abundance and microbial community structure. The proximity of a sampling site to the QTH/Qinghai-Tibet Railway (QTR), which is effectively a measure of the density of human engineering, was the dominant factor influencing bacterial community diversity. The diversity of bacterial communities shows that 16S rRNA gene abundance decreased in relation to proximity to the QTH and QTR in both alpine wetland and meadow areas. The dominant phyla across all samples were Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. The concentration of Cr and Cd in the soil were positively correlated with proximity to the QTH and QTR (MC/WC sampling sites), and Ni, Co, and V were positively correlated with proximity to the QTH and QTR (MA/WA sampling sites). The results presented in this study provide an insight into the relationships among heavy metals and soil microbial communities, and have important implications for assessing and predicting the impacts of human-induced activities from the QTH and QTR in such an extreme and fragile environment.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",69,2019

Palynoassemblage-I and II show its resemblance to the upper Karharbari and lower Barakar palynoflora of the early Permian age, respectively. On the basis of the recovered palynoflora, Artinskian age is assigned to these palynoassemblages (I and II). Four genera of megaspores have also been recovered at a depth of 202 m. By the palynofacies investigations, five distinct Palynofacies Association (A-E) has been identified. Palynofacies Association A is demarked by the predominance of the spore-pollen; Palynofacies Association B is characterized by the dominance of structured terrestrial; Palynofacies Association C is dominated by charcoal; Palynofacies Association D is distinguished by the dominance of degraded organic matter and Palynofacies Association E is marked by the predominance of amorphous organic matter. Palynofacies Association A-E is deposited in the peat-forming setting; fairly dense vegetation in the proximal settings; oxidizing conditions in exposed areas of flood plains; slight flow/ waterlogged settings and oxygen-deficient conditions in low energy settings respectively.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",111,2019

Here, in the present investigation, an attempt has been made to explore the testate amoebae species in sediments from the northern and southern part of India deposited during the Permian Period. Twenty six species have been recorded which belong to the family Arcellidae (6 spp.), Centropyxidae (8 spp.), Trigonopyxidae (2 spp.), Difflugiidae (7 spp.) and one each to Amphitremidae, Hyalospheniidae, and Trinematidae. The morphology and morphometry were studied in fossil specimens and their extant counterparts recorded from sub-tropical lakes in India. The dominance of Centropyxis, Arcella and Difflugia species is in general recorded in the present day ecosystem subjected to varied stresses, like temperature, rainfall, pH, dissolved oxygen, heavy metal content, etc. It is inferred that the fossil specimens survived the similar adverse climatic conditions and thus could overcome the two major mass extinction events. Statistical analysis of shell morphometry reveals minimum evolution in terms of the ratio of shell diameter and shell aperture.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",41,2019

All rights reserved.Mega and miofloral diversity of the coal bearing sequences of the Barakar Formation of the Block-B and Nigahi collieries, Singrauli Coalfield has been studied in detail to infer the palaeofloristics, age assessment and palaeoenvironment. A diverse glossopterid assemblage has been recorded from a sequence of Block B colliery, whereas from the Nigahi colliery no megafossil is reported. The assemblage comprises of Gangamopteris, Glossopteris and equisetalean axes. The genus Glossopteris dominates the assemblage and is represented by ten species, namely, G. arberi, G. communis, G. gigas, G. indica, G. longicaulis, G. mohudaensis, G. nautiyalii, G. raniganjensis, G. spatulata, and Glossopteris species. The genus Gangamopteris is represented by five species namely, G. angustifolia, G. cyclopteroides, G. karharbariensis, G. major and Gangamopteris sp. Interestingly, the procured fossil leaves of Glossopteris and Gangamopteris are fairly large and broad as evidenced by the abundance of Glossopteris gigas and Gangamopteris cyclopteroides species in the assemblage suggesting the existence of low light or the shady conditions in and around the vegetated area.

Further distribution of this work must maintain attribution to the author(s) and the published article's title, journal citation, and DOI.Degenerate plasmas, in which quantum effects dictate the behavior of free electrons, are ubiquitous on earth and throughout space. Transitions between bound and free electron states determine basic plasma properties, yet the effects of degeneracy on these transitions have only been theorized. Here, we use an x-ray free electron laser to create and characterize a degenerate plasma. We observe a core electron fluorescence spectrum that cannot be reproduced by models that ignore free electron degeneracy. We show that degeneracy acts to restrict the available electron energy states, thereby slowing the rate of transitions to and from the continuum. We couple degeneracy and bound electron dynamics in an existing collisional-radiative code, which agrees well with observations. The impact of the shape of the cross section, and hence the magnitude of the correction due to degeneracy, is also discussed. This study shows that degeneracy in plasmas can significantly influence experimental observables such as the emission spectra, and that these effects can be included parametrically in well-established atomic physics codes. This work narrows the gap in understanding between the condensed-matter and plasma phases, which coexist in myriad scenarios.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",64,2019

To this end, we explored whether the processing of particle verbs induces access to the stem (Experiment 1) and to a semantic associate of the stem (Experiment 2). In two cross-modal priming experiments, participants listened to particle verbs that were (a) semantically transparent (e.g. anhören, 'listen to'), (b) semantically opaque (e.g. aufhören, 'stop'), or (c) form-related (e.g. aushöhlen, 'mold') with respect to their stem (e.g., hören, 'hear'). Participants made lexical decisions about visually presented stems (e.g., hören, 'hear') and about semantic associates to the stem (e.g., Musik, 'music') in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Relative to form controls, semantically transparent and opaque particle verbs induced equivalent stem priming (Experiment 1), indicating that the lexical processing of particle verbs occurs via the stem regardless of semantic transparency. However, neither semantically transparent nor opaque particle verbs primed semantic associates of the stem (Experiment 2). These findings indicate that stem access during lexical processing does not extend to a semantic level where the meaning of the stem is processed. We discuss these findings regarding present models of lexical processing.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",40,2019

The study area was the department of Concordia (Entre Ríos, Argentina). Three CA methods were compared: supervised parametric (minimum Euclidean distance), supervised nonparametric (kNN) and unsupervised (Hybrid IsoData). The kNN, with an Overall Accuracy of 91.4 % for S2 is the most accurate method, mainly because it is less sensitive to the internal variability of the plots and because it is able to discriminate better two very similar categories spectrally. It is concluded that the CA is a tool with a high degree of accuracy and reliability that makes it useful to be complementary to photointerpretation.

Anthropogenic marine debris poses a serious threat to many marine species, both through physical harm such as ingestion or entanglement and by carrying toxins and pathogens. This debris accumulates in oceanic gyres, concentrating these effects in some specific areas. In addition, marine debris may have devastating impacts on tourism and fishing-based economies, especially where ocean currents direct this debris. Recently, a nonprofit organization called The Ocean Cleanup proposed the first large-scale in situ marine debris removal project. The Ocean Cleanup is a project attempting to use large, floating, semi-fixed screens to harness ocean currents and accumulate debris, where it can be efficiently collected and disposed of or recycled. The project currently is working on implementing itself in the “Great Pacific Garbage Patch,” in the North Pacific Gyre. We examine this project case, as it is the first organization attempting to clean up marine debris at this scale. Understanding the potential efficacy and limitations of The Ocean Cleanup Project as a case study can give critical insights into how other projects could be created in the future to address marine plastic pollution worldwide. Using SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis to assess a marine debris cleanup can inform both a nuanced evaluation of the specific case as well as provide a means to explore marine debris as a complex, global environmental problem.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",27,2019

After continuous application for 18 yr, soil and plants were sampled using 10 m × 10 m sampling grids. The results showed that application of M alone or combined CF + M increased soil total C, total N, organic matter, pH, electrical conductivity (EC) and available P compared with CF. However, M application resulted in significantly higher levels of soil pH and soil EC than for the other treatments. The highest seed yield was observed in M followed by CF + M and the lowest was observed in CF. The contour map indicated there was a medium-to-high spatial distribution for the soil properties and crop yield within and between the treatments. Soil total N content was visually correlated with soil total C, organic matter, soil pH and EC. The contour map of seed yield generally had a high visual correlation with all plant and soil parameters. High spatial distribution of soil properties and crop yield between the treatments clearly showed the effect of organic and mineral fertilizers; however spatial distribution within the treatment might have been due to the uneven distribution of applied fertilizers and soil management practices.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",35,2019

For anti-HIV activity, all fractions produced a percentage inhibition greater than 50%, with Fraction 3 being the highest (89.80%) compared to the positive control (97.06%). In addition, scopoletin was isolated from the chloroform extract of the H. orixense bark. Isolation and structural elucidation of other crude chloroform extracts will be further analyzed. The current study demonstrated the potential of developing H. orixense as an antioxidant and anti-HIV agent.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",44,2019

This is an open access article, production and hosting by Kasetsart University of Research and Development institute on behalf of Kasetsart University.Salinity is a major problem reducing crop productivity in many parts of the world. Development of salt-tolerant cultivars by screening in the vegetative stage is an effective, easy and economical way to combat salinity. The present study was conducted to determine the salt tolerance of some newly approved and candidate cultivars of wheat based on gas exchange, growth and ionic traits. Three water salinity levels-T1 [Control], T2 [electrical conductivity (EC) 2.0 dS/ m, sodium absorption ratio (SAR) 15.0 (m mol L-1)1/2 and residual sodium carbonate (RSC) 2.25 m molc L-1 ] and T3[ EC 4.0 dS/ m, SAR 25.0 (m mol L-1)1/2 and RSC 5.0 m molc L-1 ]-were developed in Hoagland's nutrient solution using four salts (NaHCO3, Na2SO4, CaCl2.2H2O and MgSO4.7H2O) and 20 cultivars grown in solution culture. A significant reduction in the leaf photosynthetic rate, plant biomass production and potassium ion uptake was observed in all cultivars under salt stress. Cultivars, SARC-1, V-07096, V-05082, SARC-7 and Fsd-2008 had less reduction in the leaf transpiration rate and plant dry biomass production than V-05003, V-07076 and V-07194. Overall, two new cultivars (V-07096 and V-05082) showed salt-tolerant traits already observed for the salt-tolerant cultivars SARC-1, Pasban 90 and SARC-7. Hence, the genetic material of these two cultivars can be used for further breeding programs for the development of new salt-tolerant cultivars.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",41,2019

The results showed that the majority of lipid metabolites was higher in the variety 7566 than the others as well as fraction IV (acids) metabolites. Notably, this variety also contained a high amount of nutritionally important phytosterols (sitostanol, campesterol, stigmasterol, ∆7-campestenol). Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis separated the varieties into three distinct groups based on metabolite abundance. Importantly, there was no separation based on kernel color. No previous research regarding differentiating colored Thai corn hybrids using metabolite profiling currently exists; thus, this method can provide valuable information for crop improvement, nutritional analysis and functional quality assessment within the food industry and nutritional sciences.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",36,2019

(Jerusalem artichoke) demonstrate great potency in the production of biological function and compounds, including exo-inulinase activity. Exo-inulinase is of interest to the beverage industry, as this enzyme hydrolyzes inulin stored within the Jerusalem artichoke tuber into fructose syrup in a single step. This study aimed to identify and investigate the exo-inulinase-producing endophytic actinobacteria from four varieties of Jerusalem artichoke (HEL65, JA89, CNS2867 and JA102×JA89) in root, leaf and stem samples. In total, 78 isolates of endophytic actinobacteria were classified into 24 different groups based on morphology and then identified based on the 16S rRNA gene into 5 genera: Streptomyces (64.1%), Nocardia (28.2%), Actinosynnema (3.9%), Kribbella (2.6%) and Kineococcus (1.3%). The results of inulinase screening using polymerase chain reaction with degenerated primers showed the specific band at 400 bp of Streptomyces gancidicus EAH-R3 which conserved the protein of the exo-inulinase gene and had inulinase activity of 125 U/mL. This inulinase was confirmed to be an exo-inulinase by checking the end product of inulin hydrolysis using thin layer chromatography. The crude enzyme of S. gancidicus EAH-R3 had an optimum temperature and pH of 60οC and 6.0, respectively. Moreover, the crude inulinase was thermostable at 80οC for 2 hr with a relative activity of 94%. S. gancidicus EAH-R3, a new isolate of endophytic actinobacteria isolated from the plant with high inulin content, is a candidate for fructose production using inulin hydrolysis.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",34,2019

The diversity was studied in nitrogen-fixing bacteria using the nifH gene along the Yamuna River in Delhi-National Capital Region. The nifH gene is a part of the nif regulon, which codes for an Fe-protein of the nitrogenase enzyme complex, responsible for the reduction of dinitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) during biological nitrogen fixation. Soil samples were collected from agricultural fields near the Yamuna River. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of soil DNA using the TReFID software package showed community comprising different nitrogen-fixing bacterial phyla, dominated by the Proteobacteria (26.87%) and Actinobacteria (2.9%). The relative abundance of these two phyla increased downstream along the river while the relative abundance of the Cyanobacteria decreased. The maximum overall microbial diversity index was lower downstream and during the summer season.

Additionally, the effect was explored of mussel gender and maturity status (juvenile or mature) on the stability of the expression of the reference genes. Three candidate HKGs were examined, namely 18S rRNA, 28S rRNA and β-actin. The expression stability was calculated using three statistical approaches-NormFinder, BestKeeper and a comparative threshold cycle (Ct) method. The study found that of the three candidate reference genes, 28S rRNA and 18S rRNA were the most stable with no significant differences when maturity, gender and exposure to BPA were considered. It was noted that when these genes (18S rRNA, 28S rRNA, β-actin) were used for normalization using animals exposed to 10 ng BPA and the qRT-PCR method, different levels of cyp4 expression were observed. However, BPA significantly decreased the expression levels of cyp4 compared to the control (animals not exposed to BPA), only when 18S rRNA was used as an internal reference. These results highlighted the importance of selecting appropriate reference genes as the endogenous control in qRT-PCR in biomonitoring programs of BPA.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",45,2019

Despite the recent increase in the number of drugs used in the antimyeloma therapy, the disease remains incurable, with remissions and subsequent relapses. Immunomodulatory drugs (IMIDs), known to have multiple mechanisms of actions, including direct anti-MM activity and immune-stimulatory properties, are currently the backbone in multidrug regimens. New generation IMIDs are recommended nowoby ESMO - lenalidomide is included in frontline therapy, while pomalidomide is accepted from the third line. Clinical trials proved lack of apparent cross-resistance between immunomodulatory agents, confirmed their high efficacy and acceptable safety profile in individuals with relapsed multiple myeloma (RRMM) refractory to proteasome inhibitors and lenalidomide, even with adverse cytogenetic abnormalities. Also, triplet pomalidomide-based combinations with bortezomib, carfilzomib, cyclophosphamide, daratumumab or elotuzumab were proved to be effective and safe in this group of patients. The most common adverse events of the new generation IMIDs are the following: hematological toxicity (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia), fatigue and, while administered with dexamethasone, infections. However, peripheral neuropathy, significantly limiting the use of first generation IMID - thalidomide, is much less frequently observed. Due to the increased risk of venous thromboembolism, thromboprophylaxis should be implemented in the whole course of IMID therapy. Data from real-life settings demonstrate that new generation IMIDs are a cost-effective treatment option in relapsed/ refractory myeloma. Currently, one drug program with the new IMIDs is available in Poland.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': 'December 2019', 'day': '31'}",56,2019

All rights reserved.Soon after the Republic of Estonia declared itself independent on the 24th of February 1918, academics and politicians of the newly formed nation wished to found a new national university built on the foundation of the former Imperial University of Tartu. This university would teach in the Estonian language, with the aim of offering higher educational studies in Estonian, as well as building up Estonian national sciences. By the spring of 1919, the committee for reopening the university was ready to open the university for studies and research in the autumn of the same year. However, they were struggling to find suitably qualified professors, as Estonians had generally been excluded from the imperial university. Prior to 1918, only three Estonians had worked as professors at the University of Tartu, while others were forced to find positions at Russian universities. In order to avoid delaying the opening of the new university, the committee decided to invite foreign professors to fill the vacant positions. They were particularly keen on Finnish professors, with whom Estonians had formed strong ties during the early 20th century. Thus, in the first half of the 1920s, Estonian research and university life was supported by eight Finnish professors. This article focuses on one of them, namely Professor A. R. Cederberg, Professor of Estonian and Nordic History, and his activity and contributions to the formation of a new field of science and its study at the University of Tartu, as well as in the rest of Estonia. As Cederberg was an experienced archivist, he was asked to help build up the archives of Estonia and organise the collection of the Estonian National Museum, while working for the University in parallel. Despite his large workload, he was able to quickly set goals and priorities for the development of Estonian historical science and its study programme at the university. Prior to the opening of the national university, Estonian history had primarily been researched by Baltic Germans, whose goals and visions of history differed significantly from those of Estonians. Cederberg believed that historical research efforts should focus more on the period of Swedish rule from the 16th century until the beginning of the 18th century. This period of Estonian history had previously been largely ignored by the historical community in favour of other historical periods. While working in mainly Finnish and Scandinavian archives during summer and winter holidays, he found many sources that shed light on the period of Swedish rule in Estonia. By directing students towards researching the early modern era in Estonia, he ensured that dozens of seminar works and Master's and Doctor's theses were written on this subject. Cederberg was not convinced that the foundation of Estonian historical science could be based only on research conducted at the university. As such he decided to found the first Estonian Academic Historical Society right after his arrival in Tartu in the early 1920s. While the primary goal of this society was to get students interested in history, particularly Estonian history, the society quickly developed into the centre of Estonian historical science. During the eight-and-a-half years he worked at the University of Tartu, Cederberg contributed enormously to the development of Estonian historical science. He built up an entirely new field of science and study based on the histories of Estonia and the Nordic countries, and educated a plethora of outstanding young historians (such as H. Sepp, H. Kruus, P. Treiberg (Tarvel), J. Vasar, E. Blumfeldt, A. Soom, O. Liiv, G. Rauch, etc.), who vigorously and effectively continued the work their professor had started.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",245,2019

All rights reserved.A university where the language of instruction was Estonian began to operate in Tartu in 1919. It continued the best academic traditions of the university that had been established in Tartu in 1632. The time period was not easy for putting the university into operation. The Republic of Estonia had been declared independent in February of 1918 and the young country immediately had to defend its independence, first in the struggle between the countries fighting in the First World War, and thereafter to fight against Soviet Russia. Although war did not spare scholars or young students, the Estonian nation nevertheless considered it necessary to start providing higher education and developing scholarly knowledge as quickly as possible. The University of Tartu became the centre for this endeavour. Among the many other problems that the university faced, professors had to be found who would meet the university's standards. Until that time, it had not been possible for Estonians to acquire higher education in their mother tongue, for which reason there was also a shortage of scholars whose academic qualifications would measure up to the professor's occupation, and who at the same time would be capable of providing academic instruction in Estonian. Especially in its first decade, in order to provide instruction in Estonian, the University of Tartu had to recruit scholars from abroad to teaching positions in order to be an academically respectable university. The university invited scholars from Finland and Sweden to assist in the first instance, hoping that they would settle in easily in Estonia's cultural and linguistic space. Yet the small Nordic countries were incapable of filling all of the vacant professor positions in Tartu, for which reason professors had to be sought from other European universities as well. This article considers professors invited or elected to work at the University of Tartu who came to Estonia from countries in the German cultural space - from Germany, Switzerland and elsewhere in Central Europe. It was not easy to find professors because there were no benefits that could be offered to attract foreigners to a small university in a newly created country. War was still being waged against Soviet Russia, and the political and economic condition of the Estonian state was uncertain at the time when the first foreign professors arrived in Tartu. The University of Tartu could attract staff only by offering interesting work with possibilities for development and career advancement. When a candidate interested in working at the University of Tartu had been found, a long correspondence between him and the university's curator began in order to determine his working and living conditions. Moving with one's family to another country was financially costly and consumed a great deal of time, and it was not risk-free, for which reason a scholar coming from abroad had to be certain that his life in Tartu would proceed without a hitch. Yet at the same time, the tempting opportunity awaited them in Tartu to be a professor who could in many respects shape his department or chair of studies according to his own preferences. It was, after all, a university where many disciplines were only taking their first steps, and even in branches of knowledge that had already previously operated at the university, newcomers were often given a free hand in choosing the directions for their development. Even though the University of Tartu was not materially wealthy and the property of many of its institutes had been taken to Russia to spare them from warfare, that did not discourage foreigners, who quickly started filling in the missing links either with the help of their own personal libraries or by ordering scientific equipment and scholarly literature from abroad. Admittedly, the university did not necessarily have sufficient monetary resources for ordering equipment and literature, and professors who came from more prosperous conditions did not necessarily understand that. Foreign professors who came to Tartu were given numerous incentives, the most noteworthy of which was bonus pay. Until 1923, some of their salary was paid to them in British pounds. Thereafter payments in hard foreign currency were discontinued, but their salary was 15-30% higher than that of other professors. Moving to Estonia was supported with the sum of 60 British pounds, and if the professor had worked in Tartu for at least three years, they could also receive compensation for moving back home. Since books were important materials for scholars in their work, up to 1,600 kg of books were exempted from customs duties. Foreign professors became Estonian civil servants, which meant that the same laws and also subsidies (the right to pension support, medical care) applied to them and the members of their families as to Estonian civil servants. Professors who came from abroad were initially allowed to give their lectures in German, yet the more distant objective at the university where instruction was to be in Estonian was that all professors would also gradually start using Estonian in their lectures. The university started concluding agreements with foreign professors that the language of their lectures would become Estonian after five years, which could be extended for another three years if necessary. Most of the foreigners who taught in Tartu were relatively young men when they arrived there, who used the opportunity to lay the foundation for their future career, which would not necessarily have been possible to do in their homeland so quickly. Cooperation between foreign professors and the University of Tartu did not always proceed without problems. Misunderstandings arising from different linguistic and cultural spaces, as well as behaviour by some foreigners that ignored the regulations of the University of Tartu, could cause discord between the two parties. Nineteen professors who were invited or elected from the German cultural space worked at the University of Tartu in the 1920s, and a closer look is taken at them in the article. Thereat their scholarly activity is not examined, rather the aim of the article is to consider more general tendencies that accompanied scholars who came from old European countries to work in the young Republic of Estonia. Some disciplines had to use foreigners for years before scholars from Estonia developed to where they could take over. For instance, Germanspeaking professors worked for years in physiology (Alexander Lipschütz, Alfred Fleisch) and pharmacology (Siegfried Walter Loewe, Georg Barkan) in the medical faculty, where it takes years to master the profession, maintaining the development of their disciplines at a high level. Scholars from outside of Estonia also worked for years as professors of foreign languages at the Faculty of Philosophy, creating a strong professional foundation, from which Estonian professors later continued. Not one faculty except for the Faculty of Religion was able to manage without foreigners from the German cultural space. Many foreigners went back to their homeland after a while, continuing their successful scholarly career paths that they started in Tartu. Only three scholars worked in Tartu for the shortest period of time, which was two years and Heinrich Mutschmann, Professor of English Philology, taught the longest, 19 years. He decided to leave Estonia in 1939 when Baltic Germans were summoned back to Germany. Although problems with foreigners could crop up for the University of Tartu and they could be costly for the university, they made a great contribution to the development of Estonian scholarship, from which Estonian scholars continued. Foreign scholars brought new ideas and schools of thought to Tartu, as well as necessary connections in European academic and scientific circles. They were full of energy and at the age when they were at the height of their creative powers. As such, they set an example in teaching and research, as well as in organisational skills, for young Estonian scholars, who continued along the path that their teachers laid out for them after the foreigners left Tartu.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",55,2019

All rights reserved.Toward the end of the 19th century, several different national bureaucratic institutions and private enterprises had evolved and expanded to such an extent that new information management tools and methods were necessary. The electromechanical data-processing system developed by Hermann Hollerith in the 1880s, which operated on the basis of punch cards, can be regarded as the predecessor of modern automatic digital data-processing systems. Information storage and data processing systems were accomplished through punch cards, i.e. carton cards in a standardised form. Information was punched onto the cards by perforating in fixed positions. Hollerith invented a number of electromechanical devices that could punch information on cards and process the cards that were carrying information. The sorter machine made it possible to sort cards by the perforated marker in a column, and the tabulator enabled counting and adding up cards. This article treats the development of punch card-based systems by demonstrating the primary modifications and correlating them with the purposes of such systems. In order to do this, I will divide the punch cardbased systems into five generations. The system was created in the United States in the 1880s to process large volumes of statistical data that had been recorded in population censuses. Several countries applied this system in everyday practice up until the beginning of the 20th century. In 1894, information systems capable of processing statistical data evolved out of this development. These systems were still in use even after the end of World War II. Solutions that facilitated bookkeeping were developed by 1906; such systems served until the 1960s, in some places even longer. Population registers based on punch cards were elaborated between 1935 and 1937, and were used by various countries until the 1960s. Upon the introduction of electronic computers after World War II, punch cards were used to enter data and programs into the computers. Punch card-based systems were the first automatic systems that were able to process large quantities of data. They were the most complex information systems from the end of the 19th century until the end of World War II, offering the most multifarious options. After the introduction of electronic computers, the application of such systems was consistently scaled back, but they were still widely in use until the mid-20th century. The experience and technical knowledge gained while applying punch card-based information systems laid the groundwork for further digital developments in computer systems. As both of these systems were used in parallel over a considerably long period of time, knowledge was shared between them. To represent data units on punch cards, data had to be encoded. This shared knowledge resulted in significant gains in the processing of information, specifically the division of data into discrete, distinctly specified units to mechanically process information, and the representation of data units on punch cards via encoding. The codes of the early punch card-based systems were case based, and had been elaborated according to the data to be analysed, and to the purposes of processing. Further developments made these encoding systems more universal, so that they came to be used as standards. Punch cards were the first data carriers that could be read by machines. Corresponding devices were employed to punch, read and process information on cards. The initial versions of these systems were easily read by the naked eye, but later the systems evolved to become completely number based. The constant increase in the amount of data recorded on the cards was the result of more complex tasks, as well as the growing abundance of calculation options on the tabulators themselves. Programming with changeable setups, which characterised the first generations of programming, was followed by conditional programming with punch cards themselves. Increased processing speed was one of the milestones in the development of punch card-based systems. The systems were characterised by a vast universality. Data, once recorded on the cards, was available for repeated analysis, regardless of the objective. Punch cards were the first databases that could be processed automatically. Nonetheless, operating mechanical information systems required a firmer organisation and standardisation of the working process.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",65,2019

All rights reserved.After the re-occupation of Estonia in 1944, the Soviets launched an extensive and diverse process of Sovietisation for building a new society. An important instrument in this campaign was the struggle that had been unleashed against so-called bourgeois nationalism. This 'struggle' culminated with the notorious 8thPlenum of the Central Committee of the Estonian Communist (Bolshevik) Party that was held in March of 1950, where the former Communist Party leader of the Estonian SSR Nikolai Karotamm was removed from his post and the campaign for purging 'anti- Soviet elements' from various spheres of life, which had already began in the first year of Soviet occupation, was given even more of a free hand. In the eyes of the regime, the Tartu State University of that time was also an important 'nest of bourgeois nationalism', for which reason it is not surprising that the state security organs demonstrated greater than usual interest in that institution. At the end of the 1940s, the 5thSection of the Tartu Department of the Estonian SSR Ministry of State Security scrutinised the university with the personal participation of the section head and a state security senior operative officer.49The thorough 'mapping' of the university's staff was carried out by the state security organs in the early spring of 1950. As a result of this, several lengthy reports were completed that provide an overview of the university's network of agents and the 'littering' of the university 'with anti-Soviet elements'. Yet these reports contain other interesting information. Valentin Moskalenko, who had only just been appointed Minister of State Security of the Estonian SSR at the start of 1950, reported to Moscow on the prevailing situation at the university in June of 1950.50Yet it was not until September of that year that he notified the leadership of the Estonian SSR headed by Johannes (Ivan) Käbin, who ascended to power in March of 1950.51It is noteworthy that statistical data on the network of agents operating at the university was also added to the end of the report sent to Moscow, but Käbin was not informed of that. V. Moskalenko's report that was sent to Moscow is published below along with essential commentaries. Jaan Isotamm (1939-2014) translated and commented on this document within the framework of a long-past research project of the compiler of this publication. The compiler of this publication has also previously published a separate article that draws on the above-mentioned reports.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",2,2019

All rights reserved.The internationally renowned Finnish archaeologist Aarne Michaël Tallgren (1885-1945) was appointed as the first professor of Estonian and Nordic archaeology at the University of Tartu in June of 1920, and he served as professor until the spring of 1923. What did Estonia, Tartu, and conditions there represent for him before he moved to Tartu? What was his idea of Estonia like, especially in relation to his identity? How and why did his view change during the autumn term of 1920? The article is based mainly on the correspondence between Tallgren and his parents and siblings at home. Tallgren's image of Estonia and Tartu, and of his own place in the community there, his attitude towards his duties as a professor, his concept of the possible development of Estonian society, and his relationship with his home during his Tartu period were formed in constant interaction with one other. Up to the autumn of 1920, Tallgren's image of Estonia was based on prehistory and some general stereotypes. His tour in the spring of 1920 made him think of Estonia as a part of his own field of work. His letters document a development process in the course of which Tallgren attempted to formulate his conception of his own duties and how he could carry them out. After settling in Tartu, Tallgren attempted to overcome the otherness Estonia represented for him by searching for features reminiscent of what he knew from home. He also tried to make his identity formation process seem as simple as possible, maybe to soothe the fears of his parents or to allow himself to settle down in a new environment. In any case, he apparently calmed down again during his first term as professor. This process may have been influenced by the stabilising political situation, the peace treaty between Estonia and Soviet Russia in February, and the parliamentary elections in November. Although a temporal relationship between the events can be seen, a causal one cannot be verified. Socially, Tallgren belonged to the community of Finnish professors in Tartu that included some Swedish professors, but like most other Finns, knowing the Estonian language meant that they did not withdraw into their own group but were able to establish and maintain contacts with local people as well. Tallgren's image of Estonia and Tartu was based on the context of his own life and professional background rather than on the events of the day. As an archaeologist and cultural historian, he sought historical explanations of what he saw and experienced around him. In the latter field it was crucial for his experience that he could convince himself and his siblings in Finland that the uncertainty he had felt about the circumstances in the spring had been unnecessary.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",92,2019

All rights reserved.A state of war was declared in the western regions of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941. This did not in any case mean only purely military operations. The safeguarding of security in the rear was considered extremely important. On 25 June 1941, the Union-wide Communist Party (CPSU) Central Committee Politburo adopted the decision 'On the tasks in the rear of front-line forces', which placed all agencies and units of the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs and State Security (NKVD and NKGB) under the command of the commanders of rear defence of the front lines. The following was prescribed as the more general tasks of rear defence: maintenance of law and order in the rear and on roads; the capture of deserters and 'disorganisers of the rear'; protection of communications; the organisation of evacuations and the transportation of supplies; the destruction of saboteurs. Since rebellion against Soviet rule also began in parallel with combat action in many regions (primarily in regions that the Soviet Union occupied and annexed in 1939/1940), then combat against the so-called internal enemy became the primary task of rear defence units in the vicinity of the front in many areas. Thirdly, rear defence units were assigned the task of destroying all property of any value that could not be removed from the region of the front in the event of possible retreat. At the same time, all communications of military importance were to be destroyed in the course of retreat. NKVD internal forces and border guard forces on the one hand, and irregular people's defence units (destruction battalions, workers' regiments, people's defence divisions, etc.) formed locally in the summer of 1941 on the other hand were to bear the brunt of this action. The various irregular people's defence units were on the one hand supposed to be manifestations of 'nationwide struggle' deriving from ideology; on the other hand, the need for an improvised territorial defence force was due to pragmatic needs that made it possible to skip many of the formalities associated with mobilisation, transport, formation and supply. At the same time, the possibilities for utilising these units were also considerably more flexible. The formation and utilisation of the 'people's defence force' varied from region to region. The destruction battalions that were formed in the Estonian SSR are considered illustratively in this article. As elsewhere in areas in the vicinity of the front, the formation of destruction battalions began in the Estonian SSR at the end of June, 1941. The 'Estonian SSR operative group of destruction battalions' was established for their formation and command at the NKVD Baltic Border Guard District headquarters. At the start of July, this operative group was placed under the command of the assistant responsible for rear area defence of the commander of the 8th Army, which had retreated into Estonia. The destruction battalions did not have any definite composition of personnel. Although the self-evidence of patriotism was stressed, in reality the battalions were manned in Estonia by way of 'Party mobilisation'. If a person was a member or candidate member of the CPSU or the communist youth organisation and did not have any other administrative duties, joining the destruction battalions was in essence mandatory. Generally speaking, this obligation also applied to the employees of other Soviet institutions as well. The operations of destruction battalions in Estonia can conditionally be divided into three periods: 1) combat against the armed resistance movement before the arrival of German forces; 2) the direct employment of destruction battalions in military assignments alongside securing the rear area; 3) the deployment of destruction battalions and regiments formed out of them at the front in combat against regular Wehrmacht units. This periodisation is nevertheless conditional. It is rather difficult to present temporal frames of reference more precisely because the actions and composition of different units varied depending on the situation at the front and they also do not match temporally. While battalions were initially formed in the counties and in the cities of Tallinn and Narva, later on units were disbanded and combined, and new additional units were also formed. In total, over 20 such units operated in Estonia (in addition to several more Latvian destruction units that had retreated into Estonia) in the summer war of 1941. Over 6,000 fighters were entered in the lists of the Estonian SSR militia companies, destruction battalions and workers' regiments. These in turn were divided up according to specific assignments: some went on raids and later fought at the front line as part of the Red Army; others were part of the armed units guarding certain industrial enterprises or Soviet institutions, or provided security for communications of military importance (railroads, bridges, communications lines, and other such sites). Third, there was a large group that was formally connected to destruction battalions because they were tied mainly to other military-administrative duties (the organisation of evacuation, fortification works, mobilisation of horses and motor vehicles, future partisan warfare, and other such duties). As the name 'destruction battalion' already says, these units were initially supposed to be used mainly in combatting saboteurs, spies and local 'bandits', and in carrying out 'scorched earth tactics'. Yet as we can already see from the previous periodization, the role of destruction battalions in Estonia already became blurred at the start of July, 1941. Since the front was breached in many places, some units that were completely unprepared for it were quickly sent to the front to plug the holes. The Southern Estonian destruction battalions that had retreated in the direction of Narva fell apart, disintegrating into isolated troops that retreated together with civilians who wanted to evacuate. Other units were incorporated into the Red Army in Northern Tartu County in the latter half of July, and most of them were cut off there in a pocket. In August, two companies were formed in Harju County and Narva out of the remnants of the destruction battalions, and were already utilised directly as front-line units. In conclusion it can be said that while the destruction battalions that operated in Estonia initially were indeed a rather effective force for a short time in the fight against armed resistance, their utilisation in front-line combat not only had negligible effect, it was also rather short-sighted in terms of Soviet rule because it resulted in the destruction of a large proportion of the cadre that was trustworthy in the eyes of the Soviet regime, and this cadre was already quite modest in numbers to begin with. A large proportion of the fighters of the destruction battalions left behind in the rear met their end in the course of vigilante justice in the summer war of 1941. And secondly, since the Germans did not count the members of the destruction battalions as soldiers, the status of prisoners of war did not extend to them, and many of them who were taken prisoner were shot on the spot or were executed at a later time as 'active communists'.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",75,2019

All rights reserved.The 18th century in Northern Europe began with a long war that profoundly altered the correlation of forces in the Baltic Sea region. During the war, the Russian authorities carried out large-scale reforms, the objective of which was to modernise the Russian state. The war and the reforms called for large expenditures, and the areas conquered during warfare were treated as a source of revenue, where customs duties could be imposed and collected. The authorities implemented a set of measures to increase state revenues, and the replacement of the old export customs duty system by a new one was among those measures. Russian authorities extended and imposed these reforms on Narva and Vyborg, which were annexed by the Russian state at the time. Though there is a sufficient number of research papers on the 18th century Russian customs duty system, they mainly focus on the subject of either the duty system in general or its implementation in St Petersburg or Arkhangelsk. Less attention has been paid to Narva in this matter. The subject of this article is the examination of the Russian government customs policy in the first half of the 18th century and its implementation in Narva. The causes of the government's customs policy measures will be researched and the changes that took place will be noted. The object of this article is to analyse the formulation and introduction of customs tariffs in the first half of the 18th century and also to clarify how consistently Russian customs duty policy was implemented in Narva. Particular cases in relation to the introduced tariffs will be examined and the consequent steps taken by the government to resolve them will be observed. Also, incoming receivables of the city treasury received from half of the portorium duty in periods when different tariffs were in effect will be discussed and compared. In the course of this research, records preserved in the Estonian National Archives were consulted: i.e., orders from the Russian government to the Narva customs office, and statistical data on customs duty income. It has become evident from this research that the new customs tariff was introduced in Narva in 1724 because the authorities wished to promote the recently built St Petersburg port, while at the same time hindering competition from Narva in trade. By comparison, hitherto existing tariffs from the era of Swedish rule remained in effect nearly throughout the entire 18th century in other Estonian and Livonian trading cities. The Russian authorities consistently extended the subsequent tariffs of 1731 and 1757 to Narva. Thereby the Russian government altered the customs system that had been in effect in the era of Swedish rule, setting Narva apart from other Baltic trading cities. In this way, Russian customs policy affected Narva considerably more than any other Baltic trading city, and these alterations influenced the operations of the Narva customs office and the customs duties collected. The tariff of 1724 was by its nature protectionist and therewith high rates were set up. Depending on the capability of Russian enterprises to supply the state with commodities, the import rate amounted to 37.5, 25 and 12.5 kopecks from a rouble ad valorem. At the same time it was necessary to pay customs duties in standard weight thalers at the compulsory exchange rate of 50 kopecks for a thaler. Nonetheless, the actual price of a thaler was higher than the price of a rouble; consequently the real import rate corresponded to 75, 50 and 25 per cent ad valorem. The required payment of the duty in thalers stemmed from the Russian government's need for silver. The fact that imported commodities came from the west, where roubles were not in use, also contributed to this requirement. After the death of Peter I, the government's point of view changed. The ruling circles realised that Russian industry was not yet sufficiently advanced and was unable to completely satisfy the state's needs. Moreover, the privileges granted to entrepreneurs did not always contribute to the development of enterprises because their owners abused the rights they had obtained and produced defective products. Additionally, such measures hindered trade by also depriving Russian consumers of the opportunity to buy essential products. On the whole, this also proved harmful for the state, since it furnished favourable conditions for the development of smuggling. The written petitions of foreign and Russian merchants to the Collegium of Commerce, the Senate and Empress Catherine I show that customs duties rates were too high. Therefore it became a necessity to decrease the tariff rate that had been introduced in 1724. In 1726, the Supreme Privy Council decided to establish a trade committee to improve commerce and work out a new customs tariff. As a result of the committee's activity, the new customs tariff was published in 1731. This tariff considerably reduced the import rate. The previous 75, 50 and 25 per cent import rates were decreased to 20, 10 and 5 per cent, respectively. The first rate was to be levied on commodities that were produced sufficiently in Russia, the second rate was for goods that were produced in relatively small quantities, and the latter rate was for goods that were in short supply in Russia. The customs tariff of 1731 was in force until 1757, when it was replaced with a new one that was also protectionist, similarly to the tariff of 1724. During the era of Swedish rule, Narva was granted the right to half of the portorium duty, i.e. the accrued revenue of the port duty. The Russian authorities preserved this privilege of Narva; however, the portorium was allotted according to different principles than before. Thus, in the era of Swedish rule, Narva received half of the portorium from all articles of commerce, whereas under Russian rule, the portorium from only a certain portion of commodities was allotted to the city. Customs tariffs, particularly in 1724, were implemented in haste, without the respective preliminary notification. As a result, merchants could not prepare the necessary documents or modify contracts in time. For that reason, the authorities admitted numerous exceptions and gave in to merchants, replacing trade prohibitions with temporary permissions.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",122,2019

All rights reserved.This article focuses on the creation of the Reval suffragan diocese in 1917 and the election of Pavel Kulbusch as the first bishop of Estonian descent. The article reconstructs the course of historical events on the basis of documents from the Russian State Historical Archive and provides a framework for understanding the events via the concept of 'church revolution' proposed by the historian Pavel Rogoznyi. The case of the Reval suffragan diocese complements the argument of Rogoznyi and suggests that processes in the Russian borderlands also contributed to the 'church revolution'. While demands for Estonian and Latvian suffragan bishops had already been put forward by Governor Shakhovskoi in the 1890s and by the Riga diocesan council in 1905, it was only in 1917 that some of these projects were given institutional form. The Orthodox assembly of the Riga diocese in August of 1917 in Tartu elected the parish priest Pavel Kulbusch from St Petersburg as bishop of Reval. The process of consecrating the new bishop took several months due to the church hierarchy's resistance to his candidature, primarily due to his ethnic origin. The documents published in this issue suggest that the institutions formed during 1917, including the diocese council (soviet) and the representative assemblies of the diocese, and the activity of nationalist Orthodox priests (such as Antoni Laar, who mobilised the Orthodox parishes in support of the bishop) rendered the formation of Reval diocese successful compared to several similar initiatives in other dioceses. The article argues that the institutions and practices formed during 1917 and the martyrdom of Bishop Platon in 1919 paved the way for the separation of the Estonian Church from the Moscow patriarchate in 1923. The translated and published documents accompanying the article are kept in the Russian State Historical Archive (in St Petersburg) and include the decrees of the Most Holy Synod; decisions made by the delegates of the congress of the ecclesiastical and secular representatives of the Riga diocese and the Temporary Council of the Riga Diocese; and individual and collective petitions in regards to restoring the suffragan diocese in Tallinn.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",42,2019

However, its etymology and its pragmatics refer to the previous semiotic concept of indicating, pointing or giving direction. From this retrospective view the research question is: what is a contemporary index? It is especially a search index, generated by a search engine through a request or search. In view of the objective of knowing the structure of a contemporary index, based on the Google search, that is generated in a Search Engine Results Page (SERP), we sought the analysis of its anatomy, that is, the constituent elements of its structure, according to Morville and Callender (2010), through a documentary analysis as a method, and the identification, from documentary research, of the basic structure of an index in Wheatley's classic essay (1879) entitled What is an index?. After the comparison of these indices, it was observed that their basic structure changed, given the performative nature of the digital substrate used as their medium, presenting more elements, at the same time as reinforcing their semiotic indexical linking aspect. They are, today, our informational compasses.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",34,2019

All rights reserved.Introduction: Older adults experience a change in their nervous system that influences cognitive function, including the abilities of orientation, registration, attention-calculation, memory and language. These changes affect the independence of the elderly when carrying out their daily activities. The purpose of this research was to analyze the effect of cognitive stimulation group activity memory game therapy on elderly cognitive function. Methods: This study used a quasi-experimental pre-post approach with a control group design. The population in this study was the elderly who were aged >60 in Nursing Home Blitar, totaling 20 older patients. The data retrieval for this research was conducted between April and May 2012. The elderly in the treatment group were given flash card stimulus to practice their perceptual abilities 8 times (1 month). The measurement of elderly cognitive function used the Mini Mental State Examination questionnaire. The data was analyzed using the Wilcoxon Sign Rank test. Results: The results showed that elderly cognitive function increased from 10,3 (pre test) to 14,65 (post test) with p=0,005 (p<0,05). This result shows that cognitive stimulation group activity memory games have a significance influence on elderly cognitive function. Conclusion: Practical nurses can use this therapy to improve elderly cognitive function not only in Elderly Social Institutions but also in the community or through public health.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",9,2019

All rights reserved.Background: The Korean model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score-based liver allocation system was started in June 2016 in Korea. Methods: This study analyzed the detailed allocation results of deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT) during the first 2 years after the MELD score-based liver allocation system implementation at a high-volume liver transplantation (LT) center in Korea. Results: This study included 174 patients with age above 12 years. The patient ABO blood groups were A (n=65, 37.4%), B (n=51, 29.3%), O (n=28, 16.1%), and AB (n=30, 17.2%). The LT types were primary LT in 141 patients (81.0%) and retransplantation in 33 (19.0%). The Korean Network for Organ Sharing status categories at LT were as follows: Status 1 (n=11, 6.3%), status 2 (n=82, 47.1%), status 3 (n=63, 36.2%), and status 4 (n=18, 10.3%). The mean MELD score at LT and waiting period were 36.6±4.6 and 62.1±98.2 days in blood group A; 37.6±3.6 and 25.7±38.1 days in blood group B; 38.8±2.7 and 26.0±30.5 days in blood group O; and 34.8±5.5 and 68.4±110.5 days in blood group AB (P<0.001 and P=0.012), respectively. Patients with blood group O and AB had the highest and lowest mean MELD scores at LT allocation, respectively. Conclusions: Serious deceased organ donor shortage resulted in very high MELD score cutoffs for DDLT allocation. Additionally, a significant inequality was observed in the possibility for DDLT according to blood group compatibility. Nationwide follow-up studies are necessary to precisely determine the allocation status of DDLT.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",13,2019

The interpretation of the results indicated that for these participants, mining is one of the primary causes of the river degradation process; however, it also shows that other factors, such as sewage and garbage dumped into the river and removal of ciliary forest, contribute to the intensification of degradation, decline in biodiversity, and health problems in the population.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",23,2019

It analyzed secondary data on water demands, sugar and alcohol production, irrigation and applies geostatistical tools. Results suggest that sugar cane crops have a strong impact on water consumption, although this activity is not related to the water deficits in most basins. This suggests that they are not solely responsible for situations of water scarcity or conflicts associated with this scarcity.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",34,2019

Data from three recent elicitation studies with a total of ten bilingual speakers of Yucatecan Spanish (YS) and Yucatec Maya (YM) and five monolingual speakers of YS suggest that contrastive focus in the Yucatecan Spanish variant spoken by the Spanish-dominant and monolingual speakers is mostly signaled by means of a high pitch early in the intonation phrase (IP) followed by a fall to the final stressed syllable of a contrasted word. In this respect, the established YS variety crucially differs from standard Mexican Spanish (MS), where the stressed syllable of a contrastive constituent is generally associated with an L+H* pitch accent (cf. de-la-Mota, Martín Butragueño & Prieto. 2010). However, the systematicity described above only shows up in the data produced by the Spanish-dominant and monolingual YS speakers, whereas the balanced bilingual data is characterized by much higher idiosyncratic variation. This fact suggests that the development of intonational systems is also a matter of consolidation or strengthening of features.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",40,2019

Methods: A quasi-experiment with a non-equivalent control group was applied as the research design. There were 60 patients involved in the study. The instrument of this study was a warmer fluid modification, a warming blanket and a cotton blanket. The data was analyzed using an applied paired t-test and independent t-test. Results: After 60 minutes of the intervention, the mean and SD of body temperature of the patients receiving warm fluids was 36.71 ± 0.18, a warming blanket was 36.12 ± 0.35, and the control group was 35.76 ± 0.22.

The purpose of this study was to prove the effect of self affirmation on anxiety, troponin I and LDH in coronary heart disease patients. Methods: The type and design of the study was quasi-experimental with a non-randomized post-test control group design. Thirty patients with coronary heart disease who were treated in the Camelia room of Dr Soetomo Hospital who had been selected were divided into 2 groups. The first group was given self affirmation twice / day for 20 minutes and the second group had standard care as the control group. After the intervention, anxiety measurements were taken, in addition to the measurement of troponin I and LDH. Results: The results showed that self affirmation reduced anxiety (ρ = 0.03), decreased troponin I (ρ = 0.003) and decreased the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (ρ = 0.006). Conclusion: Self-affirmation improves the client’s emotions, preventing damage to the heart muscle cells. This is reflected by a decrease in the troponin I and LDH levels which are indicators of heart muscle damage.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",16,2019

All rights reserved.Sentences containing definite descriptions, expressions of the form 'The F', can be formalised using a binary quantifier that forms a formula out of two predicates, where x[F;G] is read as 'The F is G'. This is an innovation over the usual formalisation of definite descriptions with a term forming operator. The present paper compares the two approaches. After a brief overview of the system INF of intuitionist negative free logic extended by such a quantifier, which was presented in [4], INF is rst compared to a system of Tennant's and an axiomatic treatment of a term forming operator within intuitionist negative free logic. Both systems are shown to be equivalent to the subsystem of INF in which the G of x[F;G] is restricted to identity. INF is then compared to an intuitionist version of a system of Lambert's which in addition to the term forming operator has an operator for predicate abstraction for indicating scope distinctions. The two systems will be shown to be equivalent through a translation between their respective languages. Advantages of the present approach over the alternatives are indicated in the discussion.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': 'December 2019', 'day': '31'}",9,2019

The application of the inference rules is said to be acceptable, if all the formulas in the upper sequents are subformula of the formulas in lower sequent. For some modal logics, Takano analyzed the relationships between the acceptable inference rules and semantical properties by constructing models. By using these relationships, he showed Kripke completeness and subformula property. However, his method is dificult to apply to inference rules for the sequent calculi for K4.3, KD4.3, and S4.3. Looking closely at Takano's proof, we find that his method can be modified to construct finite models based on the sequent calculus for K4.3, if the calculus has (cut) and all the applications of the inference rules are acceptable. Similarly, we can apply our results to the calculi for KD4.3 and S4.3.

This case study provides an integrated assessment of the FEW nexus at the city and regional scale in ten contiguous counties encompassing the rapidly growing Denver region in the United States. Spatial patterns in FEW consumption, production, trans-boundary flows, embodied FEW inputs, and impacts on FEW systems were assessed using an urban systems framework for the trans-boundary food-energy-water nexus. The Denver region is an instructive case study of the FEW nexus for multiple reasons: it is rapidly growing, is semi-arid, faces a large projected water shortfall, and is a major fossil fuel and agricultural producer. The rapid uptake of high-volume hydraulic fracturing (HVHF) combined with horizontal drilling in populated areas poses ongoing risks to regional water quality. Through this case study, fracking is identified as a major topic for FEW nexus inquiry, with intensifying impacts on water quantity and quality that reflect nationwide trends. Key data gaps are also identified, including energy for water use and food preparation. This case study is relevant to water and sustainability planners, energy regulators, communities impacted by hydraulic fracturing, and consumers of energy and food produced in the Denver region. It is applicable beyond Denver to dry areas with growing populations, agricultural activity, and the potential for shale development.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",65,2019

However, despite its ubiquity, there remains a paucity of empirical evidence to support mentoring’s use in practice. Consequently, the purpose of this paper is to present an empirical case study of a formalised mentoring programme as experienced by the mentors, and to contribute towards a critical conceptualisation of mentoring in sports coaching. Materials and methods: Eight mentors participated in the study, all being employed on a formalised mentoring programme. Data collection occurred over the 18-month duration of the programme to respect the longitudinal nature of the mentoring process. The data were analysed thematically. Results: The results emphasised the need for a clearer conceptualisation of mentoring to successfully operationalise practice. Although the relational aspect of the role was deemed crucial, developing reciprocity was challenging. This was because of the limited shared or critical understanding of the role among the participants. Discussion: Building on the portrayal of mentoring depicted in the results, we subsequently position mentoring as a relational and contextualized activity. In doing so, we claim a more realistic, coherent and effective pedagogy of mentoring.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",47,2019

The fraction of circularly permuted variants that retained function in each library correlated with AK thermostability. In addition, analysis of the positional tolerance to new termini, which increase local conformational flexibility, showed that bonds were either functionally sensitive to cleavage across all homologs, differentially sensitive, or uniformly tolerant. The mobile AMP-binding domain, which displays the highest calculated contact energies, presented the greatest tolerance to new termini across all AKs. In contrast, retention of function in the lid and core domains was more dependent upon AK melting temperature. These results show that family permutation profiling identifies primary structure that has been selected by evolution for dynamics that are critical to activity within an enzyme family. These findings also illustrate how deep mutational scanning can be applied to protein homologs in parallel to differentiate how topology, stability, and local energetics govern mutational tolerance.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",null,2019

Due to the conserved structural framework of antibodies, their specificity to antigens is mainly determined by their antigen-binding site (paratope). Therefore, characterization of epitopes in combination with describing the involved conformational changes of the paratope upon binding is crucial in understanding and predicting antibody-antigen binding. Using molecular dynamics simulations complemented with strong experimental structural information, we investigated the underlying binding mechanism and the resulting local and global surface plasticity in the binding interfaces of distinct antibody-antigen complexes. In all studied allergen-antibody complexes, we clearly observe that experimentally suggested epitopes reveal less plasticity, while non-epitope regions show high surface plasticity. Surprisingly, the paratope shows higher conformational diversity reflected in substantially higher surface plasticity, compared to the epitope. This work allows a visualization and characterization of antibody-antigen interfaces and might have strong implications for antibody-antigen docking and in the area of epitope prediction.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",null,2019

For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.In protein engineering, generation of mutagenesis libraries is a key step to study the functions of mutants. To generate mutants with a desired composition of amino acids (AAs), a codon consisting of a mixture of nucleotides is widely applied. Several computational methods have been proposed to calculate a codon nucleotide composition for generating a given amino acid profile based on mathematical optimization. However, these previous methods need to manually tune weights of amino acids in objective functions, which are time-consuming and, more importantly, lack publicly available software implementations. Here, we develop CodonAdjust, a software to adjust a codon nucleotide composition for mimicking a given amino acid profile. We propose different options of CodonAdjust, which provide various customizations in practical scenarios such as setting a guaranteeing threshold for the frequencies of amino acids without any manual tasks. We demonstrate the capability of CodonAdjust in the experiments on the complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of antibodies and T-cell receptors (TCRs) as well as millions of amino acid profiles from Pfam. These results suggest that CodonAdjust is a productive software for codon design and may accelerate library generation.

Cardiovascular disease initially only affected certain age groups but not with the current incidence of cardiovascular disease. This makes the community more susceptible to cardiovascular disease attacks. An attack of cardiovascular disease, in general, is only considered to be a cursory attack. The patients with high-risk factors must be supported by the ability of families to recognize and perform first aid in cardiovascular disease attacks. The purpose of this study was to understand the family's experience in dealing with emergency heart disease at home. Method: This study used qualitative research with a case study approach; 2 participants with family members who face emergency heart disease were selected. The data collection used semi-structured interview techniques using an observation and field notes. The data analysis used Creswell's qualitative data analysis method. The results of the study found 4 themes related to the family experience in dealing with emergency heart disease at home. Result: The themes were knowledge, past experience, values and beliefs. Conclusion: The conclusion of the study is that the family experience when dealing with emergency heart disease is strongly influenced by the knowledge that forms a value and belief which then influences the attitudes involved in decision making.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",22,2019

All rights reserved.Papaya ring spot virus (PRSV) disease has been the major impediment in papaya cultivation. The disease is transmitted through three aphid vectors and field tolerance towards this disease varies among Carica papaya cultivars as well as within the Vasconcellea genus. Leaf morphological traits are known to have influence on the probing preferences of aphids. Hence, this study was conducted to know whether the leaf parameters could contribute to the incidence of PRSV possibly by influencing the probing or feeding behaviour of aphid vectors. Leaf parameters viz., leaf thickness, leaf epicuticular wax content, presence and type of trichomes, trichome density were correlated with disease incidence at field conditions. The result revealed that leaf thickness along with epicuticular wax content had significant negative correlation with disease incidence. Similarly, trichome density had negative impact on disease incidence at 99.92% significance level. High epicuticular wax content and high trichome density in V. cauliflora and V. cundinamarcensis were found to be negatively associated with low to very low infection indicating that these parameters may have limited the vector transmission significantly.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",11,2019

All rights reserved.Strawberry, one of the most delicate, sweet and refreshing temperate fruit has grabbed the minds of several farmers and consumers all over the world. Several fungal diseases affect it. As part of the study, surveys were carried out in major strawberry growing parts of Kerala viz., Wayanad, Idukki, Malappuram and Thrissur. However, rotten fruits with dark and hard encrustations were collected only from Wayanad district during 2015-16. Pathogen was isolated by following the standard protocol and Koch's postulates were proved. Upon culturing, the fungal isolate produced white mycelia turning brown on maturation with rapid growth. The hyphae were branched at right angles and did not produce spores. The pathogen was identified as Rhizoctonia solani based on cultural and morphological characters. In vitro evaluation was carried out with 9 fungicides and carbendazim 12% + mancozeb 63%, cymoxanil 8% + mancozeb 64%, propineb and Bordeaux mixture at all concentrations showed cent per cent inhibition. Copper hydroxide and difenoconazole inhibited the pathogen from 54.44 to 75 per cent and 58.88 to 70.55 per cent at 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2 and 0.05, 0.1 and 0.15, respectively. Copper oxychloride recorded less than 45 per cent inhibition, whereas carbendazim and potassium phosphonate were found to be least effective. Comparing the efficacy of organic preparations against Rhizoctonia, calphomil recorded highest inhibition of 55.33 to 63.88 per cent at different concentrations. Panchagavya and baking powder + vegetable oil mixture could inhibit the mycelial growth only by 23.33 to 25.50 per cent and 22.22 to 26 per cent, respectively. Whereas, neem oil was found to be least effective.

The pass rate has decreased over time, but the number of examinees has increased. The aim of this study was to evaluate the nursing schools’ performance in INNCT using the Context Input Process Product (CIPP) evaluation model. Methods: A quantitative description was used in this study. The Performance Evaluation of Nursing Program Questionnaire based on CIPP was developed and used to collect the data. The participants in this study were faculty members and alumni from the nursing schools that were a member of AINEC within region V. The variables of this study were the nursing school pass rate and the school’s performance. Results: 320 participants were involved in this study. The passing rate of the nursing school in INNCT was in the moderate category. The CIPP evaluation shows that out of the four aspects, there were two (2) aspects, namely “context and input” that were in the category of having met the requirements and two (2) aspects, namely “process and product”, were in the category exceeding the requirements. Conclusion: Nursing schools have fulfilled the government regulation based on the CIPP evaluation and the nursing schools need to make a strategic plan to improve their performance and to increase their pass rate in INNCT.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",31,2019

In this study, we examined whether milk production in sheep could be improved by employing sulla as a forage plant. We used 3 groups of 15 ewes. The first two groups were grazed- one on a field containing green barley (OV) and the other on a field containing sulla (S). In both groups, each ewe received 300 g of concentrate per day. The third group was kept in a pen (B), and the ewes were given 1.2 kg of oat hay and 500 g of concentrate per day. The sulla field produced twice as much biomass as the green barley and had higher nitrogen levels.

This device constitutes a photovoltaic-thermoelectric hybrid system (PV-TEC), that combines simultaneously photovoltaic effect and Peltier effect. This hybrid system is simulated under Comsol Multiphysics and Matlab/Simulink. The results of the simulation show that the Peltier module allows cooling the cells and maintains their operation at an ambient temperature enabling them to generate their maximum power output. Thus, for all the temperatures tested, the cells lose in their power output, but as soon as the Peltier module is integrated it maintains the operating temperature of the cells at ambient so that to produce its initial power output of 2.6 W.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",7,2019

All rights reserved.Research background:The paper presents the issue of total factor productivity in the manufacturing industry in Poland. It has been assumed that total factor productivity (TFP) is a synthetic measure of efficiency of the production process and a measure of the impact of technical progress on the rate of economic growth. Purpose of the article: The main aim of the paper is to assess the differentiation in the level of total factor productivity (TFP) occurring among the Section C manufacturing divisions in Poland. In particular, the paper raises the issue of measuring and analysing the relationship between expenditure on research and development and the level of TFP in manufacturing divisions in Poland. Methods: In the presented research, the TFP level was determined by using the two-factor Cobb-Douglas production function, while econometric panel models were used to assess the studied relationship. Findings & Value added: The presented considerations show that manufacturing divisions in Poland are diversified in terms of total factor productivity. Generally, manufacturing divisions with high R&D intensity, i.e. divisions classified as so-called high-tech ones, are characterised by a high TFP level. The econometric analysis carried out allows us to conclude that expenditure on R&D incurred in manufacturing enterprises significantly affects the level of TFP.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",59,2019

This is an open access article, production and hosting by Kasetsart University of Research and Development institute on behalf of Kasetsart University.Grafting has been introduced as an alternative technique to alleviate damage to horticultural crops from water stress and to improve tolerance. In this study, non-grafted (FT) and grafted sweet pepper 'Fushimiamanaga togarashi' onto chili pepper 'Huaysiiton' (FT/HS) and 'Shima togarashi' (FT/ST) plants were grown under drought conditions. The results indicated that water stress had a considerable influence on both non-grafted and grafted plants. The growth of sweet peppers decreased due to water stress, with the FT/ST plants having a reduced decrease compared to plants with sufficient watering. Consequently, these grafted plants had the smallest yield reduction caused by water deficit. However, under well-watered conditions, non-grafted plants had greater total yields than grafted plants. The photosynthetic rates, transpiration rates and carbon dioxide intercellular space concentrations also declined significantly due to drought. The grafted plants were able to maintain photosynthesis under water stress conditions to some extent. The leaf water and leaf osmotic potentials declined substantially under water stress conditions, with the FT/ST plants having the lowest leaf osmotic potential, even though the leaf water potential remained rather high. The expression of antioxidative genes relating to CuZnSOD, MnSOD, CAT and APX were upregulated at transcriptional levels under water stress conditions, especially in FT/ST. The Shima togarashi chili pepper may have potential to be used as a vigorous rootstock under water stress conditions based on physiological adaptation and antioxidative gene expression, although it produced a lower yield than non-grafted plants under non-stressed conditions.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",42,2019

Heat stress deficits are mediated in part by reduced feed intake, but other mechanisms involved are less understood. Our objective was to determine the direct impact of heat stress on growth and well-being in ractopamine-supplemented feedlot lambs. Commercial wethers were fed under heat stress (40 °C) for 30 d, and controls (18 °C) were pair-fed. In a 2 × 2 factorial, lambs were also given a daily gavage of 0 or 60 mg ractopamine. Growth, metabolic, cardiovascular, and stress indicators were assessed throughout the study. At necropsy, 9th to 12th rib sections (four-rib), internal organs, and feet were assessed, and sartorius muscles were collected for ex vivo glucose metabolic studies. Heat stress increased (P < 0.05) rectal temperatures and respiration rates throughout the study and reduced (P < 0.05) weight gain and feed efficiency over the first week, ultrasonic loin-eye area and loin depth near the end of the study, and four-rib weight at necropsy. Fat content of the four-rib and loin were also reduced (P < 0.05) by heat stress. Ractopamine increased (P < 0.05) loin weight and fat content and partially moderated the impact of heat stress on rectal temperature and four-rib weight. Heat stress reduced (P < 0.05) spleen weight, increased (P < 0.05) adrenal and lung weights, and was associated with hoof wall overgrowth but not organ lesions. Ractopamine did not affect any measured indicators of well-being. Heat stress reduced (P < 0.05) blood urea nitrogen and increased (P < 0.05) circulating monocytes, granulocytes, and total white blood cells as well as epinephrine, TNFα, cholesterol, and triglycerides. Cortisol and insulin were not affected. Heat stress reduced (P < 0.05) blood pressure and heart rates in all lambs and increased (P < 0.05) left ventricular wall thickness in unsupplemented but not ractopamine-supplemented lambs. No cardiac arrhythmias were observed. Muscle glucose uptake did not differ among groups, but insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation was reduced (P < 0.05) in muscle from heat-stressed lambs. These findings demonstrate that heat stress impairs growth, metabolism, and well-being even when the impact of feed intake is eliminated by pair-feeding and that systemic inflammation and hypercatecholaminemia likely contribute to these deficits. Moreover, ractopamine improved muscle growth indicators without worsening the effects of heat stress.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",60,2019

The objective of the current study was to characterize the bovine vaginal bacterial community and estradiol concentrations at the time of artificial insemination (AI). Brangus heifers (n = 78) underwent a 7-d Co-Synch + controlled internal drug release estrus synchronization protocol. At AI, a double-guarded uterine culture swab was used to sample the anterior vaginal tract. Immediately after swabbing the vaginal tract, blood samples were collected by coccygeal venipuncture to determine concentrations of estradiol. Heifers were retrospectively classified as pregnant (n = 29) vs. nonpregnant (n = 49) between 41 and 57 d post-AI. Additionally, heifers were classified into low (1.1 to 2.5 pg/mL; n = 21), medium (2.6 to 6.7 pg/mL; n = 30), and high (7.2 to 17.6 pg/mL; n = 27) concentration of estradiol. The vaginal bacterial community composition was determined through sequencing of the V4 region from the 16S rRNA gene using the Illumina Miseq platform. Alpha diversity was compared via ANOVA and beta diversity was compared via PERMANOVA. There were no differences in the Shannon diversity index (alpha diversity; P = 0.336) or Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (beta diversity; P = 0.744) of pregnant vs. nonpregnant heifers. Overall, bacterial community composition in heifers with high, medium, or low concentrations of estradiol did not differ (P = 0.512). While no overall compositional differences were observed, species-level differences were present within pregnancy status and estradiol concentration groups. The implications of these species-level differences are unknown, but these differences could alter the vaginal environment thereby influencing fertility and vaginal health. Therefore, species-level changes could provide better insight rather than overall microbial composition in relation to an animal's reproductive health.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",45,2019

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society of Animal Science. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is an economically important disease, and the ingestion of soy isoflavones (ISF) may benefit PRRSV-infected pigs due to demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties. The objective of this study was to quantify the effects of ISF consumption on fecal microbiome characteristics at different timepoints across a disease challenge and determine whether any changes, if present, elude to potential biological mechanisms for previously observed performance benefits. In total, 96 weaned barrows were group-housed in a Biosafety Level-2 containment facility and allotted to one of three experimental treatments that were maintained throughout the study: noninfected pigs receiving an ISF-devoid control diet (NEG, n = 24) and infected pigs receiving either the control diet (POS, n = 36) or that supplemented with total ISF in excess of 1,600 mg/kg (ISF, n = 36). Following a 7-d adaptation, pigs were inoculated intranasally with either a sham-control (phosphate-buffered saline) or live PRRSV (1 × 105 median tissue culture infectious dose[TCID]50/mL, strain NADC20). Fecal samples were collected from 48 individual pigs at pre-infection (-2 d post-inoculation [DPI]), peak-infection (10 DPI), and post-infection (144 DPI) timepoints. Extracted DNA was used to quantify fecal microbiota profiles via 16S bacterial rRNA sequencing. Differences in bacterial communities among diet groups were evaluated with principal coordinate analysis and permutational multivariate analysis of variance using UniFrac distance matrices based on both unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances using QIIME 2. All other data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA performed on square root transformations using R. Across all timepoints, only a few differences were observed due to ISF alone mainly in lowly abundant genera. The most notable differences observed were decreased relative abundance of Actinobacteria at 144 DPI between noninfected and infected treatments (P < 0.05), which is consistent with various dysbioses observed in other disease models. Our findings indicate that the differences present were mainly due to PRRSV-infection alone and not strongly influenced by diet, which implies that previously observed performance benefits conferred by dietary ISF are not likely due to the changes in microbiome composition.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",38,2019

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society of Animal Science.Feed has been shown to be a vector for viral transmission. Four experiments were conducted to: 1) determine if medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) are effective mitigants when applied to feed both pre- and post-porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) inoculation measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), 2) evaluate varying levels and combinations of MCFA measured by qRT-PCR, and 3) evaluate selected treatments in bioassay to determine infectivity. In exp. 1, treatments were arranged in a 2 × 2 + 1 factorial with main effects of treatment (0.3% commercial formaldehyde [CF] product, Sal CURB [Kemin Industries, Inc.; Des Moines, IA], or 1% MCFA blend (Blend) of 1:1:1 C6:C8:C10 [PMI, Arden Hills, MN]) and timing of application (pre- or post-inoculation with PEDV) plus a positive control (PC; feed inoculated with PEDV and no treatment). All combinations of treatment and timing decreased detectable PEDV compared with the PC (P < 0.05). Pre-inoculation treatment elicited decreased magnitude of PEDV detection (cycle threshold value) compared with post-inoculation (P = 0.009). Magnitude of PEDV detection was decreased for CF compared with Blend (P < 0.0001). In exp. 2, pre-inoculation treatments consisted of: 1) PC, 2) 0.3% CF, 3 to 5) 0.125% to 0.33% C6:0, 6 to 8) 0.125% to 0.33% C8:0, 9 to 11) 0.125% to 0.33% C10:0, and 12 to 15) 0.125% to 0.66% C5:0. Treating feed with 0.33% C8:0 resulted in decreased (P < 0.05) PEDV detection compared with all other treatments. Increasing concentration of each individual MCFA decreased PEDV detectability (P < 0.042). In exp. 3, pre-inoculation treatments consisted of: 1) PC, 2) 0.3% CF, 3 to 7) 0.25% to 1% Blend, 8 to 10) 0.125% to 0.33% C6:0 + C8:0, 11 to 13) 0.125% to 0.33% C6:0 + C10:0, and 14 to 16) 0.125% to 0.33% C8:0 + C10:0. Treating feed with CF, 0.5% Blend, 0.75% Blend, 1% Blend, all levels of C6:0+C8:0, 0.25% C6:0 + 0.25% C10:0, 0.33% C6:0 + 0.33% C10:0, 0.25% C8:0 + 0.25% C10:0, or 0.33% C8:0 + 0.33% C10:0 elicited decreased detection of PEDV compared with PC (P < 0.05). Increasing concentration of each MCFA combination decreased PEDV detectability (linear, P < 0.012). In exp. 4, feed was treated pre-inoculation with: 1) no treatment (PC), 2) 0.3% CF, 3) 0.5% Blend, or 4) 0.3% C8:0 and analyzed via qRT-PCR and bioassay. Adding 0.5% Blend or 0.3% C8:0 resulted in decreased PEDV compared with PC and only PC resulted in a positive bioassay. Therefore, MCFA can decrease detection of PEDV in feed. Further, inclusion of lower levels of MCFA than previously evaluated are effective against PEDV.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",30,2019

For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.A novel, non-terminal surgical procedure to remove a single placentome from the pregnant ewe for gene expression and histological analyses was recently developed in our laboratory. This technique allows for evaluation of nutritional insults on placental development at more than one stage of gestation using a single animal. Early attempts to develop a similar technique in cattle were met with complications due to inaccessibility of the gravid uterine horn because of its location and mass. One alternative is to collect a placentome from the contralateral uterine horn; however, the question remains as to whether gene expression varies among placentomes based on location relative to the fetus. Pregnant heifers were maintained on forage during early gestation and later moved into pens with a Calan gate system (American Calan, Northwood, NH). On gestational day (GD) 158, five heifers were assigned to receive a hay-based diet formulated to meet 100% of NRC requirements, and five heifers were fed 70% of NRC requirements until necropsy on GD244. At necropsy, a single representative placentome was selected for analysis from the antimesometrial side: (1) of the gravid uterine horn central to the amnion, (2) over the allantois immediately adjacent to the amnion, (3) in the tip of the gravid uterine horn, and (4) in the tip of the contralateral uterine horn. Mean placentome weight was greater (P < 0.05) for locations central to the amnion and allantois compared to locations within the tips of the ipsilateral and contralateral horns, respectively. Gene expression for angiogenic factors (FGF2, ODC1, VEGFA, and FLT1), nutrient transporters (SLC7A1 and SLC2A1), and factors associated with hormone action (ESR1, IGF1, IGFBP3, CSH1, and PAG1) were unaffected (P > 0.05) by dietary treatment or location of the placentome. Results indicate that location of the placentome in relation to the fetus does not impact gene expression, enhancing the efficacy of nonterminal methodologies for sampling gene expression in placentomes.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",27,2019

However, it has also resulted in changes in behavior, metabolic and digestive function, and alterations in tissue development, including the brain and skeleton. Our study aimed to profile the behavioral traits and transcriptome pattern of chickens (broilers, layers, and dual-purpose breeds) in response to artificial selection. Broilers spent less time gathered as a group in a novel arena (P < 0.01), suggesting reduced fearfulness in these birds. Broilers also showed a greater willingness to approach a model predator during a vigilance test but had a greater behavioral response when first exposed to the vocalization of the predator. Genes found to be upregulated and downregulated in previous work on chickens divergently selected for fear responses also showed consistent differences in expression between breeds in our study and indicated a reduction in fearfulness in broilers. Gene ACTB-G1 (actin) was differentially expressed between breeds and is a candidate gene involved with skeletal muscle growth and disease susceptibility in broilers. Furthermore, breed-specific alterations in the chicken domestic phenotype leading to differences in growth and egg production were associated with behavioral changes, which are probably underpinned by alterations in gene expression, gene ontology terms, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. The results highlight the change in behavior and gene expression of the broiler strain relative to the layer and a dual-purpose native breed.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",54,2019

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society of Animal Science.Bovine anaplasmosis is the most prevalent tick-transmitted disease of cattle worldwide and a major obstacle to profitable beef production. Use of chlortetracycline-medicated feed to control active anaplasmosis infections during the vector season has raised concerns about the potential emergence of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria that may pose a risk to human health. Furthermore, the absence of effectiveness data for a commercially available, conditionally licensed anaplasmosis vaccine is a major impediment to implementing anaplasmosis control programs. The primary objective of this study was to develop a single-dose vaccine delivery platform to produce long-lasting protective immunity against anaplasmosis infections. Twelve Holstein steers, aged 11 to 12 wk, were administered a novel 3-stage, single-dose vaccine against Anaplasma marginale, a major surface protein 1a. The vaccine consisted of a soluble vaccine administered subcutaneously (s.c.) for immune priming, a vaccine depot of a biodegradable polyanhydride rod with intermediate slow release of the vaccine for boosting immune response, and an immune-isolated vaccine platform for extended antigen release (VPEAR implant) deposited s.c. in the ear. Six calves were randomly assigned to 2 vaccine constructs (n=3) that featured rods and implants containing a combination of 2 different adjuvants, diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-Dextran and Quil-A (Group A). The remaining 6 calves were randomly assigned to 2 vaccine constructs (n=3) that featured rods and implants containing the same adjuvant (either DEAE-Dextran or Quil A) (Group B). Twenty-one months post-implantation, calves were challenged intravenously with A. marginale stabilate and were monitored weekly for signs of fever, decreased packed cell volume (PCV) and bacteremia. Data were analyzed using a mixed-effects model and chi-squared tests (SAS v9.04.01, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Calves in Group A had higher PCV than calves in Group B (P=0.006) at day 35 post-infection. Calves in Group A were less likely to require antibiotic intervention compared with calves in Group B (P=0.014). Results indicate that calves exhibited diminished clinical signs of anaplasmosis when antigen was delivered with a combination of adjuvants as opposed to a single adjuvant. This demonstrates the feasibility of providing long-lasting protection against clinical bovine anaplasmosis infections using a subcutaneous ear implant vaccine construct.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",35,2019

In the first experiment, whole rumen fluid (3 mL) from six adult Suffolk sheep was incubated at 37 °C with 5 mM l-glutamine (Gln), l-glutamate (Glu), l-arginine (Arg), or l-citrulline (Cit) for 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 h or with 0, 0.5, 2, or 5 mM Gln, Glu, Arg, or Cit for 2 h. An aliquot (50 μL) of the incubation solution was collected at the predetermined time points for amino acids (AA) analyses. Results showed extensive hydrolysis of Gln into Glu and ammonia, of Arg into l-ornithine and l-proline, but little or no degradation of extracellular Cit or Glu by ruminal microbes. In the second experiment, six adult Suffolk sheep were individually fed each of three separate supplements (8 g Gln, Cit, or urea) on three separate days along with regular feed (800 g/animal). Blood (2 mL) was sampled from the jugular vein prior to feeding (time 0) and at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h after consuming the supplement. Plasma was analyzed for AA, glucose, ammonia, and urea. The concentrations of Cit in the plasma of sheep consuming this AA increased (P < 0.001) by 117% at 4 h and those of Arg increased by 23% at 4 h, compared with the baseline values. Urea or Gln feeding did not affect (P > 0.05) the concentrations of Cit or Arg in plasma. These results indicate that Cit is not metabolized by ruminal microbes of sheep and is, therefore, absorbed as such by the small intestine and used for the synthesis of Arg by extrahepatic tissues.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",71,2019

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society of Animal Science.The objective of this study was to determine the differences in response to distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) level under constant nutrient or floating nutrient concentrations. A total of 21 ileal-cannulated gilts (33.1 ± 0.4 kg body weight) were randomly allotted to one of seven dietary treatments in a 3-period incomplete Latin square design (n = 9). Treatments consisted of a 0% DDGS basal diet, plus diets containing 15%, 30%, or 45% DDGS. Diets were formulated using one of two different formulation methods: 1) constant nutrient (CNU) where nutrients were held equal to the basal diet or 2) constant ingredients (CIN) where DDGS were added at the expense of corn and all other ingredients remained constant, so nutrient levels were allowed to ""float."" Chromic oxide was added to the diets at 0.5% as an indigestible marker. Increasing the level of DDGS decreased the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of dry matter (DM), gross energy (GE), starch, dispensable amino acids (AA), and fiber components (P < 0.050). The decrease in the AID of Lys, Met, Thr, and Trp was more pronounced under CNU compared with the CIN formulation method (P < 0.050). The decrease in the AID of hemicellulose was less pronounced under CNU compared with the CIN formulation method (P = 0.045). There was a DDGS level × formulation method interaction for the AID of acid hydrolyzed ether extract (AEE; P = 0.015); for the CNU formulation method, increasing level of DDGS decreased the AID of AEE from 0% to 30% and remained similar from 30% to 45% DDGS, whereas the CIN had no effect on the AID of AEE. Increasing the level of DDGS decreased the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM, GE, and fiber components (P < 0.050), except for acid detergent fiber, which was not affected. The decrease in the ATTD of insoluble dietary fiber and total dietary fiber was less pronounced under CNU compared with CIN (P < 0.050). The ATTD of AEE decreased for CNU compared with CIN (P < 0.010). In conclusion, increasing the insoluble fiber level in the form of DDGS decreased the digestibility of most dietary components, including DM, GE, starch, insoluble fiber, and AA. The CNU and CIN formulation methods are equivalent when evaluating the digestibilities of DM, GE, starch, crude protein, and AA (when they were not added in purified synthetic forms). Differences between CNU and CIN formulation methods were detected for the digestibility of insoluble fiber, fat, and essential AA (when added as crystalline AA).","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",39,2019

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the American Society of Animal Science.Improving the ability of animals to convert feed resources into food for humans is needed for more sustainable livestock systems. Genetic selection for animals eating less while maintaining their performance (i.e., low residual feed intake [RFI]) appears a smart strategy but its effectiveness relies on high-throughput animal phenotyping. Here, we explored plasma nitrogen (N) isotope ratios in an attempt to identify easily superior young bulls in terms of RFI. For this, 48 Charolais young bulls fed two contrasting diets (corn vs. grass silage diets) were selected from a larger population as extreme RFI animals (24 low-RFI vs. 24 high-RFI) and their plasma analyzed for natural 15N abundance (δ15N) in the whole protein (bulk protein) and in the individual protein-bound amino acids (PbAA). For the first time, we showed that 15N in plasma bulk protein differed (P = 0.007) between efficient (low-RFI) and inefficient (high-RFI) cattle regardless of diet. Furthermore, most analyzed PbAA followed the same trend as the bulk protein, with lower (P < 0.05) δ15N values in more efficient (low-RFI) compared with less efficient (high-RFI) cattle, again regardless of diet. The only three exceptions were Phe, Met, and Lys (P > 0.05) for which the first metabolic reaction before being catabolized does not involve transamination, a pathway known naturally to enrich AAs in 15N. The contrasted isotopic signatures across RFI groups only in those PbAA undergoing transamination are interpreted as differences in transamination rates and N-use efficiency between low- and high-RFI phenotypes. Natural isotopic N signatures in bulk proteins and specific PbAA can be proposed as biomarkers of RFI in growing beef cattle fed different diets. However, the current study cannot delineate whether this effect only occurs post-absorption or to some extent also in the rumen. Our data support the conclusion that most efficient cattle in terms of RFI upregulate N conservation mechanisms compared with less efficient cattle and justify future research on this topic.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",34,2019

We investigated the effects of multienzyme supplement (MES, Victus) on standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of amino acids (AA) and apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of energy and minerals in roasted full-fat soybean (FFSB) seeds and expelled-extruded soybean meal (SBM) fed to growing pigs. The crude protein (CP) was 33.4% and 42.8% dry matter (DM) in FFSB seeds and SBM, respectively and corresponding values for crude fat were 17.4% and 11.8% DM. Semi-purified diets with 50% of either FFSB seeds or SBM as the sole source of AA were prepared without or with MES supplying phytase, protease, xylanase, and β-glucanase at 2,200, 8,300, 400, and 100 U/kg of feed, respectively. Diets had TiO2 as an indigestible marker and the ratio of cornstarch to sucrose and corn oil was identical to calculate DE by the difference method. Eight ileal-cannulated barrows (22.1 ± 0.61 kg) were fed diets in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square design to give eight replicates per diet. The period lasted for 9 d: 5 d for acclimation, 2 d for fecal, and 2 d for ileal digesta samples. There was no (P > 0.05) interaction between soy type and MES or MES effect on SID of AA; SBM had higher (P < 0.05) SID of CP, His, Leu, and Lys. There was no (P > 0.05) interaction between soy type and MES on energy digestibility. The FFSB seeds had higher ATTD of gross energy (GE, 80.2% vs. 76.6%; P < 0.01) than SBM. Pigs fed MES had higher (P < 0.05) ATTD of DM (91.3% vs. 87.7 %), GE (87.5% vs. 82.4%), CP (86.4% vs. 82.9%), crude fat (70.6% vs. 54.9%), Ca (63.2% vs. 60.2%), and P (67.5% vs. 63.2%). In conclusions, differences on AA and energy digestibility in soy products could be linked to processing and compositional differences. Although MES had no effect on SID of AA, the effects on the utilization of minerals and energy demonstrated the value of fiber-degrading enzymes, protease, and phytase in improving the nutritive value of soy products independent of processing.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",42,2019

For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.In this study, we aimed to assess the value of genotyping DNA pools as a strategy to generate accurate and cost-effective genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) of sires in multi-sire mating systems. In order to do that, we used phenotypic records of 2,436 Australian Angus cattle from 174 sires, including yearling weight (YWT; N = 1,589 records), coat score (COAT; N = 2,026 records), and Meat Standards Australia marbling score (MARB; N = 1,304 records). Phenotypes were adjusted for fixed effects and age at measurement and pools of 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 animals were explored. Pools were created either by phenotype or at random. When pools were created at random, 10 replicates were examined to provide a measure of sampling variation. The relative accuracy of each pooling strategy was measured by the Pearson correlation coefficient between the sire's GEBV with pooled progeny and the GEBV using individually genotyped progeny. Random pools allow the computation of sire GEBV that are, on average, moderately correlated (i.e., r > 0.5 at pool sizes [PS] ≤ 10) with those obtained without pooling. However, for pools assigned at random, the difference between the best and the worst relative accuracy obtained out of the 10 replicates was as high as 0.41 for YWT, 0.36 for COAT, and 0.61 for MARB. This uncertainty associated with the relative accuracy of GEBV makes randomly assigning animals to pools an unreliable approach. In contrast, pooling by phenotype allowed the estimation of sires' GEBV with a relative accuracy ≥ 0.9 at PS < 10 for all three phenotypes. Moreover, even with larger PS, the lowest relative accuracy obtained was 0.88 (YWT, PS = 20). In agreement with results using simulated data, we conclude that pooling by phenotype is a robust approach to implementing genomic evaluation using commercial herd data, and PS larger than 10 individuals can be considered.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",15,2019

We show, in several such instances and without any complexity theoretic assumption, that no algorithm that is expressible in fixed-point logic with counting (FPC) can compute an approximate solution. Since important algorithmic techniques for approximation algorithms (such as linear or semidefinite programming) are expressible in FPC, this yields lower bounds on what can be achieved by such methods.

Genetic variation in SWSC and its mobilization can be useful to increase the grain yield of wheat under harsh environments. Hence, a set of 16 genotypes varying in spike morphology and grain yield was grown in field under timely sown, late sown and terminal drought stress conditions. The anthrone method was used to measure the SWSC concentration in the dried peduncle and penultimate internodes in three replicates at 3 growth stages starting from anthesis. The effect of delay in sowing and terminal drought on the SWSC concentration was significant from anthesis to 14 days after anthesis. Significant genetic variation was observed in the rate of post anthesis change in SWSC during the early grain filling period under the three conditions which partially contributed to the variation in grain yield per spike among the genotypes. Due to sterile florets and/or shorter grain filling duration, all the genotypes did not have a correlation between grain weight per spike and rate of decrease of SWSCs. Thus, our experiments reconfirm the significance of SWSC in present cultivars of wheat and also the scope for exploiting the genetic variation in this trait.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2019

Pulse crops, which include beans, peas, lentils, and chickpeas, have become an important addition to both human and animal diets due to their protein content and functional properties. However, knowledge of their nutrient composition and protein quality is necessary for the proper formulation of these ingredients in pet foods. The objective of this study was to determine the macronutrient composition and standardized amino acid digestibility and to describe the protein quality through the use of digestible indispensable amino acid scores (DIAAS-like) of five pulse ingredients. Black bean (BB) grits, garbanzo beans (GB), green lentils (GL), navy bean (NB) powder, and yellow peas (YP) were analyzed for dry matter (DM), ash and organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), gross energy (GE), acid hydrolyzed fat (AHF), and total dietary fiber (TDF) to determine the macronutrient composition. Precision-fed rooster assays were conducted using cecectomized roosters to calculate standardized amino acid digestibility and true metabolizable energy corrected for nitrogen (TMEn). The essential amino acids, with the exception of methionine, were highly digestible with digestibility values of 80% to 90% (dry matter basis) for all selected pulse ingredients. BB grits had the lowest (P < 0.05) digestibility of arginine (86.5%) and histidine (80.6%) in contrast to GB (94.9% and 89.9%, respectively). The TMEn of GB was highest (P < 0.05) at 3.56 kcal/g compared with the other pulses. The DIAAS-like values for adult dogs were consistently the lowest for methionine for all pulses, making it the first-limiting amino acid in these ingredients. The DIAAS-like values for adult cats showed GL had lowest (P < 0.05) score in tryptophan compared with other pulses when using both AAFCO values and NRC recommended allowances as reference proteins. Methionine was the first-limiting amino acid for YP and tryptophan for GL. Based on macronutrient composition, protein quality, and amino acid digestibility, it can be concluded that pulse ingredients have the required nutritional characteristics to be viable protein sources in canine and feline foods. However, the use of complementary protein sources is recommended to counterbalance any potential limiting amino acids in pulse ingredients.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",37,2019

So far, insufficient work has been done on fast software implementation of SM4 algorithm. Exploiting bit-slicing technique and SIMD (single instruction multiple data) instruction set AVX2, this paper presents a fast implementation of SM4 algorithm which can process 256 blocks in parallel via 256 bits YMM registers. Firstly, a new selection function is constructed based on existing ones. Then, the logic circuit generating algorithm corresponding to the selection function is improved. Furthermore, the number of gates of the S box is reduced from 3000 to 497. Using an Intel Core i7-7700HQ(Kabylake)@2.80 GHz processor, the software performance is 2580 Mbps, 43% ahead of SM4's benchmark on software implementation which is 1795 Mbps (Intel Core i7-5500U (Broadwell-U) @2.40 GHz). Bit-sliced implementation does not require to store a table in memory or in cache, hence it is immune to side channel attacks such as cache attack and timing attack. The improved method presented in this paper can be implemented on various computing platforms, which means that it is suitable to X86 architecture with extended instruction set AVX2, and is also suitable to embedded systems with RISC instructions and limited resource. Note that the improved selection function and the improved logic circuit generating algorithm are a generic approach, which can be used to the reduction of general logical functions.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2020

They apply under different conditions, but do not cover the full range of many-body models. It is hence desirable to further expand the toolbox. Here, we propose to use quasiparticle properties to detect quantum phase transitions. The approach is independent from the choice of boundary conditions, and it does not assume a particular lattice structure. The probe is hence suitable for, e.g., fractals and quasicrystals. The method requires that one can reliably create quasiparticles in the considered systems. In the simplest cases, this can be done by a pinning potential, while it is less straightforward in more complicated systems. We apply the method to several rather different examples, including one that cannot be handled by the commonly used probes, and in all the cases we find that the numerical costs are low. This is so, because a simple property, such as the charge of the anyons, is sufficient to detect the phase transition point. For some of the examples, this allows us to study larger systems and/or further parameter values compared to previous studies.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",43,2020

All rights reserved.Galvalume steel (GL) is widely used in marine and industrial environments. It is characterized by better corrosion resistance than carbon steel. However, corrosion and economic losses may occur as the usage time is increased. Therefore, in this study, an outdoor exposure test of GL for 36 months was conducted across six regions of Korea. Parameters such as corrosion rate, chrominance (color, chroma, and brightness), glossiness, and surface appearance were analyzed. The results showed no significant change in appearance, and the initial corrosion rate was large, but a tendency to decrease with time was observed. Increased outdoor exposure time led to increase in the level of corrosion products. In the case of coastal areas where S, Cl, and other elements were detected, a relatively high decrease in Zn content was observed. Al forms a protective oxide film and exists in the coating layer, but Zn dissolves due to its chemical activity and low potential.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",26,2020

All rights reserved.This paper examines the governance options for reurbanisation in medium-sized cities by using the example of Bamberg. The key questions are: Which planning approaches are developed in the areas of action housing and urban development to shape reurbanisation? How do local actor constellations and relationships shape the governance options? The contribution follows on debates about local reurbanisation drivers and an understanding of planning in terms of governance. The results show that Bamberg aimed to develop a conversion area and has thus implemented planning instruments and political-administrative structures. However, the use of the conversion areas by non-municipal actors in addition with municipal actors that are strongly guided by monetary considerations prevents the conversion in the further course and severely limits the governance options. As a result, a departure from the goal of a planned reurbanisation can be seen. The paper concludes by discussing the context under which growth policies for reurbanisation are developed and implemented.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",62,2020

All rights reserved.Objective Antibiotic stewardship should be an essential component of neonatology training as neonatal intensive care units (NICU) have unique stewardship needs. Our aim was to assess neonatology fellowship trainees' knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions about antibiotic stewardship to inform sustainable curriculum development. Study Design We distributed an electronic survey to neonatology fellows in the United States over 4 months (January-April 2018) via Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education program directors. Results Of 99 programs in the United States with an estimated 700 fellows, 159 (23%) fellows from 52 training programs (53%) responded to the survey and 139 (87%) provided analyzed responses. Majority of respondents were training in southern (59; 42%) and northeastern (43; 31%) regions and were equally spread across all 3 years of training. One hundred (72%) respondents reported an antibiotic stewardship program (ASP) in their institution. While 86% (120/139) were able to identify the components of an ASP, 59% (82/139) either did not or were unsure if they had received antibiotic stewardship training during fellowship. Furthermore, while answering case studies, 124 (89%) respondents identified the optimal antibiotic for methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infection and 69 (50%) respondents chose appropriate empiric antibiotics for neonatal meningitis. Notably, fellowship training year was not significantly related to the proportion of incorrect knowledge responses (p = 0.40). Most survey respondents (81; 59%) identified small group sessions as the most useful teaching format, while others chose audit and feedback of individual prescribing behavior (52; 38%) and didactic lectures (52; 38%). Finally, ninety-five (69%) respondents preferred trainee-led ASP interventions targeting focal areas such as antifungal and surgical prophylaxis. Conclusion Antibiotic stewardship is a critical part of neonatology training. Neonatology fellows report variation in access to ASP during their training. Fellows prefer dedicated trainee-led interventions and stewardship curriculum taught within small group settings to promote targeted NICU ASP. Key Points Most neonatology programs expose trainees to internal or external antibiotic stewardship programs. Over half of fellow trainees are unsure about receiving targeted antibiotic stewardship training. Most neonatology fellows prefer a trainee-led antibiotic stewardship intervention.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",11,2020

Romani communities are settled in Italy since the early modern era and, therefore, Romani speakers of old settlement in Italy are all Italian citizens, but they are divided in many groups, which differ considerably from one another. They have different self-representation and show different linguistic repertoires. In any case Romani is spoken in Italy by many thousands of Italian citizens and the Law No. 482/1999 regarding minority languages does not include Romani among the minority languages to be protected and enhanced. This exclusion finds its roots primarily in an erroneous representation of the Romani communities, perceived as nomadic communities; in fact they are no more nomadic at all. The situation of Romani language and of its speakers in Italy is however rather complex. Romani is spoken in Italy by many people, but not by all Roma and Sinti groups and it is highly differentiated in many Romani dialects, sometime not mutually intelligible. This intricate landscape together with the distorted representation of Romani speakers that is found among non-Romani Italian citizens makes complex any step in the path towards a national legitimation, which however remains an important civil right. A recent regional law enacted by the Regional Council of Calabria recognizes the Romani minority and its linguistic specificity. This fact suggests the possibility that local and not national laws can be a more suitable tool to legitimate and protect Romani in Italy.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",42,2020

This applies not only to the historical development of its minoritisation and to the steadiness of its claims to recognition and protection but also to the way, during the last decades, that the community has been trying to promote its language and concretely affirm those fundamental rights related to the use of the language itself, through laws and actions of language policy and planning. The contribution aims to present the Friulian case, illustrating the evolution of legislation and policies and identifying their impact on the language itself, its formal and informal use, its social presence, the community’s legitimation, self-representation and delimitation, and the establishment of language rights. It is an interesting path with noteworthy results. It is also a discontinuous itinerary, with ups and downs, in which most of the protection rules (Law 482/1999 and the Regional ones 15/1996 and 29/2007) have not found real application. Therefore, the language is still excluded from several fundamental contexts and, despite some encouraging data coming from the most recent sociolinguistic research, its public use and its presence in education and in the media are still victims of old prejudices, which inspire the contradictory choices of political and institutional decision-makers. Friulian is at the same time a resistant and emerging language and a strongly minoritized one.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",71,2020

[Methods] A total of 10 healthy men (21.55 ± 2.16) were selected. In each environmental condition (20℃, 10℃, 0℃), the three testing order was randomly selected at crossover, and there was a week interval between the graded exercise test (GXT). On the testing day, they remained resting for 30 min in each environmental condition. Dependent variables (body temperature, energy metabolism parameters, skeletal muscle oxygenation profiles, and exercise performance parameters) were measured at rest and during GXT. [Results] In body temperature, at each environmental condition, there was a significant decrease (p<.05) at 10℃ and 0℃ compared with 20℃ after exercise, and in the difference depending on the environment at rest. After exercise, the body temperature significantly decreased (p<.05) in proportion to the decrease in temperature. There was no difference in heart rate and blood lactate level in energy metabolism, and the respiratory exchange ratio was significantly higher (p<.05) at 0℃ than 20℃. Minute ventilation (VE), oxygen uptake (VO2), and carbon dioxide excretion (VCO2) were significantly lower (p<.05) at 0℃ than 20℃ and 10℃ at various exercise load. All skeletal muscle oxygenation profiles did not show significant changes at rest and during exercise.

Despite their widespread use, these models are sometimes viewed as inflexible with respect to time delay and dwell time assumptions. The Generalized Linear Chain Trick (GLCT) provides a theoretical foundation that can help modelers incorporate much more flexible phase-type distributed delay (or dwell time) assumptions into ODE models, including traditional exponential and Erlang distribution assumptions. The GLCT serves as a bridge between stochastic processes and dynamical systems theory for ODEs, opening up opportunities to use concepts and tools from Markov chain theory in the development, analysis, and interpretation of ODE models. To facilitate the practical application of this theory, in this paper we introduce a new GLCT-based procedure for deriving new ODE models by generalizing or approximating existing ODE, DDE, or distributed delay equation models. We apply this procedure to multiple models from the literature, using it to derive new models that are generalizations or approximations of those models.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",37,2020

Published by the American Physical Society.The potential energy landscape (PEL) formalism is a theoretical approach within statistical mechanics used extensively in the past to study classical liquids and glasses. Here, we extend the PEL formalism to the case of quantum liquids. As an example, we apply the PEL approach to study a family of quantum monatomic liquids using path-integral Monte Carlo simulations. We focus on the energy (EIS) and pressure (PIS) of the local minima of the PEL [inherent structures (IS)] explored by the liquids. It is found that, similar to the classical case, the quantum liquids exhibit a PEL-independent regime at high temperatures and a PEL-influenced regime at low temperatures, where the topography of the PEL plays a major role. Interestingly, the PEL of all the quantum liquids studied is Gaussian, providing a simple expression for the configurational entropy of the liquids. Remarkably, the ring-polymers representing the atoms of the quantum liquids are collapsed at the IS. Accordingly, an IS of the quantum liquid, in its own PEL, is also an IS of the classical liquid in the classical liquid PEL (CL-PEL). A pictorial interpretation of the behavior of quantum liquids using the CL-PEL (as opposite to the quantum liquid PEL) is provided. In this view, the quantum liquid is represented by a pancakelike patch that expands over multiple IS of the CL-PEL, changing shape with time while describing a fuzzy trajectory (on the CL-PEL). The formalism described in this work is general and can, in principle, be extended to quantum systems other than liquids.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",66,2020

Second, we take mean length of utterance (MLU) into account to see how the level of proficiency influences the amount of priming in each child. Results indicate that children with a lower MLU rely more on priming than children who are more proficient.

All rights reserved.In the typological literature, a distinction is often drawn between reduplication (as a morphological process) and repetition (as a syntactic process) (Gil 2005). This squib reconsiders this distinction from the perspective of Construction Morphology (Booij 2010, 2018; Masini and Audring 2019). Drawing upon previously understudied phenomena in Tagalog, an Austronesian language of the Philippines, this paper demonstrates that the Construction Morphology approach provides a suitable framework for analyzing reduplication and repetition. It makes it possible to account for both similarities and differences between reduplication and repetition: both processes create a lexical unit with an iterative form and a conventionalized meaning, although they differ in the size and complexity of the lexical unit they create. Furthermore, this paper makes a strong case for the basic tenets of constructionist approaches, including a hierarchical lexicon and a lexicon-grammar continuum.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",18,2020

A qualitative diachronic analysis of ′at/a yode′a/′at suggests that speakers may associate forms with interactional patterns rather than with functions.

It points out an intriguing constructional phenomenon whereby causal adjunct clauses marked with node 'because', as used with main-clause predicates that evoke communication frames (such as Telling and Warning), serve to satisfy main-clause argument structure. The node clause precedes the main-clause speech act of telling/warning, and can be interpreted as a speech-act causal (Sweetser 1990). The node clause at the same time conveys the content of informing or warning, i.e., the core Frame Element message, which is absent as a main-clause complement. This analysis of argument structure satisfaction via unselected adjuncts provides evidence for a Frame Semantic approach to argument structure that incorporates Construction Grammar.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",13,2020

It will be shown that, even though constructionists claim that there is no semantics-pragmatics distinction, both these underlying concepts are central to the study of constructions. Therefore, the aim is twofold. First, in keeping with Cappelle (2017), it will be argued that constructionists should make more explicit the distinction between the two types of (encoded) meaning. Second, it will be shown that constructionists need to be more terminologically consistent and agree on how to use the terms semantics and pragmatics.

All rights reserved.This squib focuses on two main issues. Firstly, it examines the ways in which constructionist approaches to language can bring about an improved theoretical understanding of Double Modals (DMs) in dialects of English. DMs have proved to be a long-lasting, notorious puzzle in formal linguistics, and have not received any general solution today, with much analysis devoted to their constituent structure and their postulated layers of derivation, especially in generative models of language. Usage-based strands of Construction Grammar (CxG) appear to naturally overcome such problems, while conveying a more cognitively and socially realistic picture of such dialect variants. Secondly, and more importantly, we argue that such an improved, constructional understanding of DMs can also contribute to advances in the modeling of dialect syntax in CxG, both theoretically and methodologically. In particular, DMs constitute an interesting case of relatively rare and restricted syntactic constructions in the dialects they appear in, and they are likely to exhibit different rates of entrenchment and network schematicity cross-dialectally. Moreover, the empirical challenges surrounding the measurement of DM usage invite us to refine the methodological concept of triangulation, by sketching a two-step approach with a data-driven study of new types of corpora on the one hand, and a hypothesis-driven experimental account of acceptability in relevant geographical locations on the other.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",51,2020

Unfortunately, while the construction grammar community has developed a sophisticated understanding of what a construction is supposed to be, many critics still believe that a construction is simply a new jacket for traditional linguistic analyses and therefore inherits all of the problems of those analyses. The goal of this article is to refute such criticisms by showing how constructions can be formalized as open-ended and multidimensional linguistic representations that make no prior assumptions about the structure of a language. While this article's proposal can be simply written down in a pen-and-paper style, it verifies the validity of its approach through a computational implementation of German field topology in Fluid Construction Grammar.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",34,2020

All rights reserved.This squib briefly explores how contextualized embeddings - which are a type of compressed token-based semantic vectors - can be used as semantic retrieval and annotation tools for corpus-based research into constructions. Focusing on embeddings created by the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer model, also known as 'BERT', this squib demonstrates how contextualized embeddings can help counter two types of retrieval inefficiency scenarios that may arise with purely form-based corpus queries. In the first scenario, the formal query yields a large number of hits, which contain a reasonable number of relevant examples that can be labeled and used as input for a sense disambiguation classifier. In the second scenario, the contextualized embeddings of exemplary tokens are used to retrieve more relevant examples in a large, unlabeled dataset. As a case study, this squib focuses on the into-interest construction (e.g. I'm so into you).","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",25,2020

All rights reserved.While the concept of extravagance, used to describe speakers' use of imaginative and noticeable language, has seen a surge in popularity in recent constructionist work, researchers have not yet converged on a set of common criteria for identifying extravagant expressions. In this paper, we discuss a variety of existing definitions and combine them into five main characteristics of extravagant language. We then present the results of a small-scale pilot rating study in which speakers judged extravagant sentences and their non-extravagant paraphrases. Our findings suggest that different constructions vary in their degree of perceived extravagance, and that certain features (e.g. stylistic salience) apply to most extravagant examples while the role of other factors (e.g. the speaker's emotional involvement) may be restricted to a subset of extravagant patterns. We conclude with some open questions concerning the further demarcation and operationalisation of the concept of extravagance.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",23,2020

The etiology is unknown, the diagnosis is made through the clinic based on the criteria of the DSM-V or ICD-10, and the treatment currently available provides a limited response. In general, patients do not recognize the disorder, do not seek medical attention, and have low adherence to treatment. In one clinical case, for example, a middle-aged man who presents a Celotypic Delusional Disorder directed at his wife gradually compromises the quality of his life and puts the family at vital risk; their response to the atypical antipsychotic was partial, but it improved family life considerably. This clinical case is important because this pathology is not very prevalent or well-understood by professionals in the health area or other related disciplines. There are also no media publications on the subject, so it is necessary to publicize these types of cases and provide information for an early diagnosis with timely treatment.

The cinematograph and the Analyticon regularly shared the same bill; the latter was a stereoscopic technology built upon the principle of polarised light that depended upon a silver screen to work. Within the context of Edinburgh, stereoscopy directly shaped the ideological and aesthetic character of early cinema, giving local exhibitions a distinctiveness from the rest of Scotland and further afield.

The data are 19 video-filmed semi-structured interviews with patients presenting MUS. Four patterns of gestural behaviors are established in symptom presentation: (1) No gesturing; (2) Overall low gesture rate; (3) Overall high gesture rate with low rate for symptoms; (4) Overall high gesture rate with high rate for symptoms. The patients with overall low gesture rate tend to perform deictic gestures, pointing to exact locations of the symptoms; those with overall high gesture rate and low symptom rate produce metaphorics, and those who gesticulate at high rates - mainly iconics and metaphorics. Although exact factors that lead to the four types of gesturing patterns are unclear, the findings encourage medical professionals to attend to the information in gesture use in order to obtain a better understanding of the patient's experience of MUS.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",62,2020

Specifically, the paper evaluates the validity of two arguments concerning constructed action: that constructed action forms a continuum with regular narration, and that constructed action divides into three subtypes (i.e., overt, reduced, and subtle). The results presented in the paper support the first argument but not directly the second one. Because of the ambiguous position of reduced constructed action in between subtle and overt constructed action, we argue in the paper that the present threepart typology of constructed action may need revising. As an alternative way of subcategorizing the phenomenon we propose a division between strong and weak constructed action.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",26,2020

Co-speech gestures that depict the height of upright entities - performed with a flat hand, palm facing downwards - come to serve various linguistic functions in YMSLs: a noun for human referents, a verb GROW, a spatial referential device, and an element of name signs. Special attention is paid to how height-specifier gestures fulfil a grammatical purpose as noun-classifiers for human referents in YMSLs. My study demonstrates processes of lexicalisation and grammaticalisation from gesture to sign and discusses the impact of gesture on the emergence of shared sign languages.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",44,2020

After a mid-century period of neglect, fieldwork has recently been revived as a means to address the increasing rate of language endangerment worldwide. Twenty-first century American fieldwork inherits some, but not all, of the traits of earlier fieldwork. This article examines the history of one controversial issue, whether a field worker should adopt a monolingual approach, learning and using the target language as a medium of exchange with native speakers, as opposed to relying on interpreters or a lingua franca. Although the monolingual approach is not widely practiced, modern proponents argue strongly for its value. The method has been popularized though 'monolingual demonstrations' to audiences of linguists, which, curiously, are not wholly consistent with the character of 21stcentury fieldwork.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",124,2020

However, little research has explored the role of gesture mimicry in technology-based learning contexts. In this research, we examined variations in the rate and form of students' gestures when learning from a computer-animated pedagogical avatar. Twenty-four middle school students received a lesson on polynomial multiplication from a gesturing avatar video instructor. After the lesson, students were asked to provide an explanation of what they learned. Students varied in their gesture rates, and some students produced gestures that were similar in form to the avatar's gestures. Students who produced gestures that aligned with the teacher's gestures scored higher than those who did not produce such gestures. These results suggest that middle school students' gestures play a key role when learning a mathematics lesson from an avatar instructor.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",47,2020

This introduction is followed by an annotated translation of Ščerba's essay, proposed here for the first time to an Englishspeaking readership (Read the English translation at https://doi.org/10.1075 /hl.00075.sce). The critical introduction provides the backstory behind Ščerba's conception of language as a means of helping the reader to understand the connectedness of the various strands of his linguistic research. As is shown in our introduction, Ščerba's general distinction between linguistic raw material, the linguistic system and individual speech activity (the ""threefold aspect""alluded to in the title of his essay) serves as a framework to conceptualise metalinguistic practice and the relation of the social dimension of language to its individual embodiment. An examination of the explanatory potential of Ščerba's conception of language for general linguistic problems suggests that his achievements lay in formulating a cohesive account of the interconnectedness of language phenomena, identifying the linguistic means with which to understand the social nature of language, and providing a theoretical basis for addressing the practical tasks of linguistics.

We investigated the integration of speech and cospeech gestures in memory for verbal information with different emotional connotations (either positive, negative, or neutral). In a surprise cued-recall task, gesture boosted memory for speech with all three emotional valences. Interestingly, gesture was more likely to become integrated into memory of neutrally and positively valenced speech than negatively valenced speech. The results suggest that gesture-speech integration is modulated by emotional valence of speech, which has implications for the emotional function of gesture in language comprehension.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",54,2020

These catalysts were prepared by the combination of a modified sol-gel and a precipitation-deposition method using hydroxypropyl cellulose as structural linker and they were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–Vis DRS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nitrogen physisorption isotherms techniques. The catalysts containing TiO2 as a shell and CuO as core showed much higher activity compared with those formulated with NiO@CuO, CuO@NiO, and bared CuO or NiO nanoparticles. The highest rate of hydrogen production obtained with the CuO@TiO2 catalyst was as high as 153.8 μmol·g-1h-1, which was 29.0, 24.8, 11.2 and 3.2 times greater than that obtained on CuO@NiO, NiO@CuO, TiO2 P25, and NiO@TiO2 catalyst, respectively. For the high active CuO@TiO2 catalyst, after activation of TiO2 with solar light irradiation, the conduction band electrons can be transferred to CuO core through the heterojunction in the core-shell interfaces which led to CuO gradually reduced to Cu2O, favoring the reduction of proton to release hydrogen.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",44,2020

All rights reserved.In the light of momentous technological development and market competitiveness, designers struggle to generate creative and successful designs to survive in the market and stay competitive. However, being in such a stressful work environment, any slip, or flaws during the design stages, particularly those related to manufacturing, can make design more vulnerable to fail. Therefore, the designer is in need of aiding means to guarantee minimizing and controlling these costly errors. Thus, this paper presents a new tool, called DesMod, to help the novice designers as well as the design students avoid such issues, as well as to save time, effort and cost. Through DesMod, the designer can assess the manufacturability of the design and receive design modification suggestions and feedback at early design stages. This can be achieved by simply importing 3D CAD models in STEP or IGES format within DesMod. Next, the design features can be recognized in a hybrid way, either automatically and/ or manually; then mapped to the corresponding database in the background. Any additional manufacturing-related information such as materials, surface quality, production volume, among others, can be also entered. Once information about the design is entered and mapped, the manufacturability assessment and the associated design modification suggestions can be generated and stored in PDF format. In this paper, the casting module of DesMod was tested with many designs ranging from simple to complex, and acceptable results were obtained.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",21,2020

By applying this procedure, the information obtained, it is structured in such a mode so that it can be used on the training of intelligent systems focused on fault diagnosis. The former procedure is necessary in the intelligent systems development stage because obtaining an effective training set requires extreme time and effort. The procedure was applied in the historical records of the Amaime hydroelectric power plant, located in Palmira, Valle del Cauca, Colombia, aiming to obtain patterns of behavior of the protection system which can be translated to different failures. This was possible by integrating a data mining technique such as hierarchical clustering and the statistical technique called the interpolation function. The main achievement of this work is to present a structured procedure that reduces the time to obtain a training set. In this specific case, the training set for mechanical failure of a hydroelectric power station was obtained, which can be used in the development of an intelligent system for failures diagnosis.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2020

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY-NC)As 3D scanning and photogrammetry are supplanting traditional illustration techniques with increasing speed, archaeologists and architectural historians have sounded alarms about what stands to be lost if hand drawing is altogether eliminated from fieldwork. This paper argues that the most direct threat is to a particular form of archaeological illustration which does not necessarily share the advantages attributed to other kinds of drawing. Recording by means of “technical drawing” communicates a collectively agreed interpretation of the ancient record, and its primary benefit is not stimulating creative thought but rather enhancing human observation. A review of two cases comparing the illustration of ancient Greek architecture through analogue and digital methods indicates that, in practice, both approaches draw attention away from the ancient subject and focus it on distracting protocols for the great majority of the time spent in the field. Even so, technical drawing requires a protracted, in-person scrutiny of the subject, whereas 3D technologies pose a genuine risk of altogether eliminating meaningful human interpretation from the recording process. The greater efficiencies of digital techniques suggest a path forward, as time once allocated to tedious stages of technical drawing might be applied toward more thoughtful interpretive tasks. However, such measures must be deliberately integrated into a digital research program through planning around the very different cadences of the digital process.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",74,2020

Over this time, a subtle transition has occurred in which contentious debates over the value and practicality of 3D tools, such as photogrammetry, 3D scanning, 3D reconstruction, and virtual reality (VR), have given way to an emergent consensus that these constitute a new and important class of recording and heuristic instruments. Rather than seek to cover this fundamental shift in a comprehensive matter, this issue presents a characteristic cross-section of current archaeological research based in three-dimensional computational methodologies. The content cuts across some 3000 years of Mediterranean archaeology, from the Aegean Bronze Age to the later Roman Empire, underlining the discipline-wide impact of this methodological revolution.

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY-NC)While space syntax analysis has been widely applied to archaeological sites (including Pompeii), it is fundamentally limited by its isolation within the social sciences and its omission of decoration from the analysis of human cognition and movement within structures. At the same time, phenomenology in archaeology has typically arisen from the physical experiences of a limited number of professional archaeologists in a landscape, with little interest in digital embodiment in virtual spaces. The Virtual Pompeii Project has produced an updated version of space syntax which combines network measures common in the social sciences with visibility graphs to produce predictive models of movement within a set of three ancient Roman houses in Pompeii. These predictive models are tested through the navigation of virtual models of the houses by human subjects, demonstrating the significance of decoration in shaping movement, and, through quantitative and qualitative data, the value of digitally embodied phenomenology. This points ahead to the use of crowd-sourced, web-based global testing, diversifying the subject pool far beyond the narrow bounds of professional classicists or archaeologists.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",60,2020

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution License (CC BY-NC)The last decade of advances in Image-Based Modeling (IBM) data acquisition based on Structure from Motion (SfM) have made it possible as never before to record excavated archaeological deposits, historical architectural remains, artifacts, and geographical surroundings in the field. Armed only with digital cameras and low-cost or open-source software, researchers can now produce accurate point clouds of millions of points, capturing archaeological information in high-resolution detail. But what changes will IBM really bring to the standards, requirements, and expectations of practical field methodology for projects operating on shoe-string budgets? Since 2010, the Via Consolare Project, a small archaeological research project from a State level University, has employed an entirely open-source and “free for academic use” IBM pipeline to record a variety of archaeological features in Insula VII 6 and the “Villa delle Colonne a mosaico” in Pompeii. Ranging from surviving architecture, to rubble fill layers, to the interiors of inaccessible cisterns and drains, this work has been carried out in preparation for the eventual coordination of these data into a 3D GIS of all recorded stratigraphy.

The mechanism shows that the active droop factor is negatively associated with the transient stability whereas the reactive droop factor is positively associated. The transient stability enhancement is implemented by increasing the reactive droop factor and reducing the active droop factor to raise the power angle curve. The proposed control scheme adjusts the droop factors dynamically during the transient events through detecting the real-time electrical quantities.

All rights reserved.Purpose—To characterize the prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSD), symptoms, and risk factors among ophthalmologists. Methods—An online survey was distributed to ophthalmologist members of the Maryland Society of Eye Physicians and Surgeons. The survey consisted of 34 questions on respondent demographics, practice char-acteristics, pain, and effects of MSD on their practice patterns. Participants were excluded if they were not ophthalmologists or if they had MSD symptoms prior to the start of their ophthalmology career. Demographics and practice patterns were compared for those with or without MSD symptoms using the Welch t test and the Fisher exact test. Results—The survey was completed by 127 of 250 active members (response rate, 51%). Of the 127, 85 (66%) reported experiencing work-related pain, with an average pain level of 4/10. With regard to mean age, height, weight, years in practice, number of patients seen weekly, and hours worked weekly, there was no difference between respondents reporting pain and those without. Those reporting MSD symptoms spent significantly more time in surgery than those who did not (mean of 7.9 vs 5.3 hours/week [P < 0.01]). Four-teen percent of respondents reported plans to retire early due to their symptoms. Conclusions—A majority of respondents experienced work-related MSD symptoms, which was associated with time spent in surgery. Modifications to the workplace environment focusing on ergonomics, par-ticularly in the operating room, may benefit ophthalmologists.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",23,2020

All rights reserved.With the demand and development of homomorphic encryption, academia and industry pay close attention to the efficiency of all kinds of homomorphic encryption libraries. In order to test the efficiency of homomorphic encryption libraries, a fair and scientific comparison method is proposed in this paper. The security level and circuit depth are taken as two key reference points, and corresponding test methods under these two reference points are studied. The test methods are mainly divided into three types. First, the efficiency of homomorphic multiplication is compared on the same key point. Second, homomorphic evaluation on the encrypted data is compared with the corresponding evaluation on the plaintext data. Last, homomorphic operations are performed on the standard algorithm, such as the logic regression algorithm in machine learning. Through these three types of tests, the performance of all kinds of homomorphic encryption libraries can be tested. In addition, this paper also proposes noise growth test, ciphertext size changes with parameter size test, ciphertext packaging performance test and other tests. In order to give a variety of performance indicators and analysis intuitively, the Python interface library is developed with a report chart generation tool. The test system (HEBenchmark) can automatically complete the whole test process, and can add any known homomorphic encryption library to the system, which is convenient for non-professional users.

This makes the passwords vulnerable to password guessing attack, especially when the attackers have a large mount of leaked account data. To address this vulnerability, this paper proposes an identity-based password protection scheme. The proposed scheme is dual server based to overcome the weakness of using one server (maybe malicious). The proposed scheme is proved to achieve IND-ID-CCA2 security in the random oracle model. It is shown that the algorithm in this paper is more secure than the traditional hash algorithm. Although the performance analysis shows that the proposed algorithm performs a bit worse than the hash-based algorithm in both computation and communication overhead, however, it has the property that the same input will get different outputs in different executions, which improves the security against password guessing attack.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",45,2020

Methods: A prospective study performed from January 2019 to March 2020. The patients were randomly distributed by chit method into two groups: Group A (Control) without the use of hemostat and Group B (Case) with oxidized regenerated cellulose gauze as a hemostat. Results: There were 26 patients with 19 males and 7 females. There were 13 patients in Group A and 12 in Group B; while one patient succumbed before surgery.

On exploratory laparotomy, a swollen raisin was found impacted in the ileum causing intestinal obstruction. The history taken in retrospect revealed that the elder sibling had witnessed her father perform a traditional ritual of putting a drop of honey into the mouth of the newborn and she imitated the same with a raisin, which led to the obstruction. Conclusion: A careful detailed history of local traditional rituals is at times, the most important pointer towards the etiology of a clinical condition. The basic clinical skill of history taking is still very important, despite the availability of advanced radiological investigations.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",25,2020

The context of nation-building processes is considered along with approaches to formulating a national idea and national (civic) identity. Particular attention is paid to the discourse of the authorities. Through a comparative political analysis, the general and special characteristics of the models introduced in the EAEU countries, constants and dominants of discursive practices are revealed. The argumentation of representatives of the top political leadership in their attitudes to the proposed guidelines and priorities of socio-political development through an appeal to the value component taking into account the relationship of internal and external dimen-sions is shown. It is emphasized the lack of demand for the ethnocentric model of patriotic discourse and the relevant practices of political actors due to the complex composition of the population of most countries of the Union and other internal and geopolitical circumstances. At the same time the commitment to construc-Tive orientation, the absolutization of sovereignty, and the motivation and positions that impede the adoption of balanced integration decisions can be revealed. It is suggested that the national idea of Russia cannot be limited to patriotism and that its de-politicization and de-ideologization cannot be absolutized.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",16,2020

In addition to a deep economic shock, other problems are attributed to the characteristics of the current cycle (sometimes referred to as ""neo-normal"") such as welfare loss and deepening social inequalities. Complicated social environment objectively forces the governments on both sides of the Atlantic to search for medium term strategies for social protection of the most vulnerable strata of society. There is an acute issue of the State's ability to cope with the consequences of the pandemic crisis, to find ways for economic recovery and overcoming social difficulties that have arisen. The hypothesis is put forward that Transatlantic interaction in the field of social policy will help to find more effective measures for solving some social problems in Latin American region.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",30,2020

Meanwhile, this topic is related to solving the issues of increasing the economic and social efficiency of labor immigration to main European cities, and the conclusions of the study may be in demand, including in our country. We have used the me-Thod of rapid (three-question) survey of these immigrants. Special attention is paid to labor immigrants in Germany and Bulgaria. A certain disunity between Arab communities from different Mashriq countries, a significant business and cultural distance with people from the Maghreb is revealed. There is a difference in world view between Eastern Arab immigrants and European residents, as well as a relative diasporal isolation (cultural and business) of labor immigrants. The difference in the situation of the communities under consid-eration in several European countries is small. It is based on the comparable rootedness of communities, pri-marily in the respective diasporal networks more than in the local business environment. A long-Term forecast for the development of migration to Europe is given, which implies that the dynamics of immigration of East-ern Arabs will not grow, but will even decrease over time.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",18,2020

As the core of that investigation, I chose a late thirteenth-century English bestiary of the so-called Second Family (Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Bodley 533). In that article I suggested that further research would likely uncover more such examples in non-bestiary manuscripts. This was confirmed in 2018 by a newly discovered fragment in Cambridge University Library, MS Oo.vii.48, containing the verses present in MS Bodley 533, and additional verses about animals and birds. Using this fragment, I put forward the idea that there was an established medieval tradition of collecting and keeping organized mnemonic verses devoted to animals and birds.

Therefore, it is paramount to restrain the migration of contaminants from soil to rice grains to cushion their impact on human health. However, the opposite biogeochemical behaviors of As and Cd in paddy soils under flooding condition make it a great challenge to simultaneously immobilize both As and Cd, particularly for the large-scale remediation. In this work, lime, Fe2O3, and Fe-Mn binary oxides (FM) were performed for immobilizing As and Cd in paddy soil at a field-scale experiment, and their associated mechanisms were discussed. Results showed that 0.10 wt% of Lime reduced Cd in grain (36.68%), 0.60 wt% of Fe2O3 decreased the accumulation of As and Cd (28.32% and 26.91%, respectively), and 0.60 wt% of FM significantly decreased As and Cd (42.42% and 36.49%, respectively). Analytical results of As speciation in rhizosphere soils demonstrated that FM played a dual role in oxidation and adsorption toward As immobilization. The DGT-measured As and Cd concentrations in rhizosphere soils showed that 0.60 wt% of FM significantly reduced the bioavailability of As and Cd in the paddy soil by 65.63% and 52.98%, respectively. Moreover, 0.60 wt% of FM promoted the formation of Fe/Mn-plaque on root surface, which significantly enhanced the adsorption of As and Cd upon Fe/Mn-plaque (44.06% and 32.14%, respectively) and further inhibited the uptake of As and Cd by rice. Hence, the mechanism for As and Cd immobilization by FM can be summarized: (1) oxidation of As(III) to As(V) and transformation and immobilization of As and Cd in rhizosphere soil and (2) promotion of Fe/Mn-plaque formation on root surface to retard the uptake of As and Cd by rice. These efforts attempt to set up a theory-to-practice solution for remediating As and Cd co-contamination in paddy soil.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",45,2020

Underestimation of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from various large facilities on South Korea’s northwest coast may contribute to this problem, and this study focuses on quantifying top-down emissions of formaldehyde (CH2O) and VOCs from the largest of these facilities,the Daesan petrochemical complex, and comparisons with the latest emission inventories.To accomplish this and additional goals discussed herein, this study employed a number of measurements acquired during KORUS-AQ onboard the NASA DC-8 aircraft during three Daesan overflights on June 2, 3, and 5, 2016, in conjunction with a mass balance approach. The measurements included fast airborne measurements of CH2O and ethane from an infrared spectrometer, additional fast measurements from other instruments, and a suite of 33 VOC measurements acquired by the whole air sampler. The mass balance approach resulted in consistent top-down yearly Daesan VOC emission flux estimates, which averaged (61 + 14) × 103 MT/year for the 33 VOC compounds, a factor of 2.9 + 0.6 (+1.0) higher than the bottom-up inventory value. The top-down Daesan emission estimate for CH2O and its four primary precursors averaged a factor of 4.3 + 1.5 (+ 1.9) times higher than the bottom-up inventory value. The uncertainty values in parentheses reflect upper limits for total uncertainty estimates. The resulting averaged top-down Daesan emission estimate for sulfur dioxide (SO2) yielded a ratio of 0.81–1.0 times the bottom-up SO2 inventory, and this provides an important cross-check on the accuracy of our mass balance analysis.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",35,2020

As is often the case, this process of textual transmission gave rise to variation and multiple interpretations: the sole Nemean lion is, in some instances, replaced by a pair of two felines or even a leonine trio, a phenomenon that can be observed both in text and iconography. The present contribution aims to elucidate the history of a particular variational pattern involving three Nemean lions, as seen in Raoul Lefèvre's 15th century Recoeil des Histoires de Troyes.

Although cultivation of urban produce lowers the carbon footprint of food production by removing transportation to market, there is a lack of studies that investigate both toxic element profiles and nutrient content of produce in these nontraditional settings. In this study, we examined the lead (Pb) content and essential nutrient profiles of fruit harvested from the Greater Boston urban landscape in settings ranging from city streets to urban parks to residential and commercial properties. Partnering with League of Urban Canners, a local urban harvesting organization, we created, followed, and assessed a modified participatory action research model that we call the flashlight model. Fruit samples were analyzed using X-ray fluorescence, a novel, environmentally sustainable, and economically feasible method to investigate the elemental composition of produce. Results indicated that on a fresh weight basis, averages for all urban fruit harvested in this study (with the exception of urban apples) had lead concentrations ([Pb]) below the maximum limit set by the European Commission. Daily Pb intake from consuming a serving of urban fruit was comparable to daily Pb exposure from drinking water at the maximum contaminant level. Across a suite of plant nutrients (including calcium, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, copper, iron, manganese, and zinc), urban harvested apples and pears were 19% enriched on average compared to market samples. This study suggests that urban fruit and public produce in general could be further developed to facilitate science-based community transformations, as well as supporting the consumption of locally sourced, nutrient-rich produce and promoting food sovereignty.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",55,2020

This is an offence perpetrated, primarily, with malicious lan-guage—either written language (libel), spoken language (slander), or technospeech (Gar-field, 2011: 17)—that involves social emotions and intentional false communication and harms a person’s dignity, prestige, and reputation in the social community. Since the 1980s, linguists have tried to shed light on defamation as a language crime from various linguistic theories such as speech act theory, semantics, discourse analysis, and pragmatics, as shown in works by Durant (1996: 195–210), Hancher (1980: 245–256), Kniffka (2007: 113–148), Shuy (2010) and Ti-ersma (1987: 303–350). In this paper, we take a different path in suggesting a sociopragmatics-based approach to the analysis of defamation, with special reference to impoliteness (Cul-peper, 2011; Spencer-Oatey, 2005: 95–119). The questions we discuss are: (1) Is the theory of impoliteness appropriate for evidencing actionable offence in cases involving defamation? (2) How do the High Courts of Justice of Spain appraise defamatory meaning? (3) Does conven-tionalised formulaic impoliteness promote guilty verdicts? And (4) Does non-conventional-ised impoliteness support acquittals? This piece of research is grounded in empirical data, par-ticularly in a corpus of 150 judgments for cases of defamation given by the High Courts of Justice of Spain between 2013 and 2017.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': 'December 2020', 'day': '31'}",44,2020

The goal of the present study is to determine phenotypic diversity and to detect elite trees. Six hundred eighty individuals of argan tree (Argania spinosa (L,) Skeels) were characterized by using sixteen qualitative and quantitative agro-morphological traits. Majority studied characteristics were showing a high degree of variability, but it was highly pronounced for fruit-spine, branches number, trunk diameter and first leaf height. A significant correlation was found among some studied variables. The principal component analysis for quantitative traits showed that three components explained 54% of the total variation and revealed that traits related to fruits, leaves, crown diameter and trunk diameter contributes for a large proportion of the observed variability. The results indicated that most of trees can be considered a good gene pool for breeding programs and rootstock development programs. More, they could be useful as a parent to be crossed to generating appropriate populations or improve cultivars.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",42,2020

All rights reserved.Over the past four decades the Western Ghats of India, one of the eight hottest hotspots of biological diversity in the world, witnessed the transformation of its prime forests into other land-use types, mainly monoculture plantations. The present study evaluated the impact of conversion of natural forests to mixed-species (teak) and monoculture (rubber) plantations on the soil quality of a Typic Plinthohumults soil series in the Southern Western Ghats region of Kerala, India. The baseline physico-chemical and biological parameters of the different sites were analyzed using standard methods. To comprehend the impact of plantations on the overall soil quality, the soil quality index of the different land-uses was quantified using the forest as the reference land-use. Significant variations in different soil physical, chemical, and biological properties of plantation and forest soils were observed in the present study. The overall soil quality index was found to follow the order: Forest (1.0) > teak plantations (0.9) > rubber plantations (0.6), thus signifying the negative impact monoculture rubber plantations had on the soil quality of the study area. The results emphasize the need for the development of better land management practices and mixed-species plantation systems such as the teak plantations in the present study which did not deteriorate the soil quality.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",81,2020

Based on the three pillars of sustainability (economic, social, and environmental), adopters of minimum tillage practice (scoring 0.5, 0.6, 0.82) and the combined adoption of minimum tillage and integrated organic-inorganic fertilizer application (scoring 0.53, 0.5, 0.88) emerged as sustainable practices. Despite these scores, the z-test of difference in means of the conservation practices and conventional ones were all insignificant, indicating that the conservation practices in use were not different from the conventional ones in terms of their contribution to sustainable maize production. Technical assistance and training that aids in ensuring the appropriate application of conservation practices should be ensured if the goal of sustainability is to be realized.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",44,2020

All rights reserved.The history of São Tomé and Príncipe (STP) shows that the development of the roças, plantations established in colonial times, form a heritage linked to the human development of STP. Various agricultural products have characterized the historical periods of migration, slavery, creolization, and gender emancipation up to the present day; agricultural products and the history of creolization make STP unique, while the relationship between culture and nature provides a useful tool for a better understanding of its historical roots. The essay argues that STP's sustainable development could be fostered by valorizing its historical agricultural heritage. Agri-food geographical indications (GIs), which directly link territories, peoples, and traditions could also serve this purpose. GIs could lead to raising the export price of STP's cocoa, coffee, and pepper, at the same time increasing cultivation of a number of other crops, especially indigenous fruits, which are usually planted in combination. These systems have proven to lead to better prices for products and increase the specialist labour market; they could also foster a multi-faceted approach to territorial development, including eco-tourism. However, challenges remain, as the country is still lacking in proper infrastructures, skilled labour, management, and institutional support. The question will be whether STP's fragile agri-food setting is able to support these new mechanisms, which require strong value chains, respect for territorial biodiversity, and a fresh look at the role played by small farmers running AgriSMEs.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",73,2020

All rights reserved.Field studies on saline water use (6 dS/m) for carrot, lettuce and pepper production in smallholder's farms were conducted in the arid region of Medenine-Tunisia. The irrigation regimes were full (FI) and deficit (DI-80, DI-60, FI-DI60) irrigated with levels of 100, 80 and 60% of ETc when 40% of total available water in the root zone in the FI treatment was depleted, and farmer method (Farmers). Results show that the greatest values of soil salinity were observed under Farmers (FM) and DI-60 treatments. Relatively low ECe values were also recorded under FI-DI60 and DI-80 treatments. The highest mean yields of carrot (26.8-28.7-29.5 t/ha), lettuce (42.6-45.8 t/ha) and pepper (22.3-24.4 t/ha) were recorded for the FI treatment, that is not significantly different from the FI-DI60 and DI-80 treatments. Compared with FI, significant reductions in carrot, lettuce and pepper yields were observed under the DI60 and Farmers treatments, resulting from a reduction in yield components. The Farmers's method increased soil salinity and resulted in an increase of water use of 43-57% for carrot, 26-29% for lettuce and 11.5-16% for pepper. Water productivity (WP) values reflected the differences in yields and varied between 3.4 (Farmers) and 9.7 kg/m3 (DI-80) for carrot, 7.5 and 19.1 kg/m3 for lettuce and 2.4 and 5.5 kg/m3 for pepper across different years and treatments. The soil water balance-based irrigation method (FI) generated the greatest net income compared to the Farmers treatment in carrot, lettuce and pepper productions under arid environment and the lowest soil salinization. FI scheduling technique is suggested for optimizing saline water use for vegetable crops. Under water scarcity, the adoption of the FI-DI60 and DI-80 strategies results in 4.5 to 20% water savings as compared to FI with small impact on salinity in the root zone and yield and net income reductions.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",35,2020

The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences and correlation between the serum level of IL-6, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and cortisol in RAS patients. Our study was cross-sectional and used a consecutive sampling method. There were significant differences of IL-6 and ROS levels in all groups (p = 0.000, p = 0.049 respectively) and a significant correlation between cortisol and ROS in the RAS group without atopy (r =-0.985, p = 0.015). Serum IL-6 and ROS measurement may be used for detecting RAS caused by malnutrition or atopy but not cortisol for patients without psychological stress detected. This is consistent with the results of a very strong correlation with a negative value between cortisol and ROS in RAS without atopy.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",42,2020

First FOSMC is implemented to voltage source inverter with a fixed DC input voltage of 400V to drive a load of 2.3 kW at a power factor of 0.8 lag. Here the load voltage and current through capacitor as state variables and a linear sliding surface are considered. FOSMC using Gao's reaching law is derived for inverter circuit. FOSMC is implemented at load bus to control output voltage of inverter with linear and nonlinear loads to desired values. FOSMC controls the output voltage with good voltage regulation, less steady state error of 1.32 %, settling time of 0.15 ms, good dynamic response, and convergence to origin with less chattering compared to classical SMC. FOSMC based solar based VSI is presented. The maximum power from PV array is extracted using P&O MPPT algorithm. A boost converter is used to step up input voltage of 200 V to 400 V. P-V and I-V characteristics are obtained for a typical solar cell of 2.5 kW FOSMC requires less control efforts to obtain a pure sinusoidal output voltage waveform of 230 V (rms) with output voltage THD of 0.135% well within IEEE standards.

The risk of exposure and the impact of heat stress conditions on mortality were measured by the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) index. The impact on health was estimated by applying exposure-response curves between WBGT and health outcomes in the projections. The potential impact on mortality was measured by attributable fraction of mortality due to heat stress. The results showed an increase in heat stress conditions for Brazil, especially in the Northern and Center-Western regions. The estimated curves showed an association between the WBGT and mortality by cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in Brazil, with an upward impact trend, according to the levels of warming and heterogeneous results among the capitals.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",48,2020

All rights reserved.Climate change affects human health either directly or indirectly, and related impacts are complex, non-linear, and depend on several variables. The various climate change impacts on health include a change in the spatial distribution of vector-borne diseases. In this regard, this study presents and discusses changes in the spatial distribution of climate suitability for visceral leishmaniasis, yellow fever and malaria in Brazil, in different global warming scenarios. Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) was used to construct climate suitability models in warming scenarios. Models were based in climate variables generated by the Eta-HadGEM2 ES regional model, in the baseline period 1965-2005 and RCP8.5 scenario, representing global warming levels of 1,5°C (2011-2040), 2,0°C (2041-2070) and 4,0°C (2071- 2099). The three diseases studied are largely influenced by climate and showed different distribution patterns within the country. In global warming scenarios, visceral leishmaniasis found more favorable climate conditions in the Southeastern and Southern regions of Brazil, while climate in the Northern and Center-West regions gradually became more favorable to yellow fever. In malaria scenarios, an increase in favorable climate conditions to its high incidence was observed in the Atlantic Forest, where currently extra-Amazonian cases occur. The scenarios presented herein represent different possible consequences for the health sector in terms of adopting (or not) different measures to mitigate climate change in Brazil, such as reducing the emission of greenhouse gases.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",83,2020

The degree of dependence on soil type determines the applicability of the method. The aim of the present paper is to evaluate the single-and multi-step extraction methods included in the study in terms of the environmental mobility of Cu, Zn, Fe and Ni. For the studies, we selected four samples with different physical soil types from the Soil Information and Monitoring System database. In order to establish trends, soil samples were selected so that their clay and humus content, i.e., their adsorption capacity as well as their pH increased in the order of sand, sandy loam, loam and clay soils. One-step extractions with five different extractants and two sequential extraction analyses including 3+1 steps were performed (BCR and McGrath methods). We also performed the digestion of the samples with H2O2 + HNO3 solvent combined with microwave treatment according to the Hungarian Standard (MSZ 21470-50). The element content determined in this way can be considered as the ""total""element content from the environmental point of view. Based on the results of the analyses, we tried to select from the methods included in the study those that already extract a safe amount of elements from the soil, but the extracted amount is not yet proportional to the total element content. The Zn, Cu, Fe and Ni contents resulting from microwave digestion increased in the order of sand, sandy loam, loam and clay soils, i.e. in parallel with the clay and humus content and pH of the soils. As the extractants containing chelating agents extracted about one-Third of the total copper content, the amount extracted was proportional to the copper content, i.e. it increased in parallel with the increase in copper content. Thus, in the case of copper, these extractants are less suitable for detecting differences in the toxicity of different soil types. In contrast to copper, in the case of the other three elements, the small amounts extracted from each soil type also differed in order of magnitude, so according to our theoretical consideration, it can be assumed that they show a difference between the toxicity of each soil type. The results obtained with iron using the two sequential methods could not be evaluated due to their standard deviation. It can be stated that BCR uses more aggressive extractants than the McGrath method, accordingly, the BCR method extracted 36%, whereas the McGrath method only 9% of the elements on average of the soils. The BCR method does not have an aqueous weak extractant, which would indicate the amount of ions released from the total element content of the different soils. Acetic acid is the weakest extractant, but in addition to the exchangeable element content, it also extracts the ionic element content bound to carbonates, which is certainly not free. Because a large amount of elements is extracted with each extractant in the BCR method, there is no significant difference in the percentage of elements extracted for each soil, which, given that soil element content increases from sand to clay soil, means that the extracted amount is proportional to total element content. Basically, the same can be said for the two more aggressive extractants of the McGrath method, despite the fact that they extract significantly less amount of elements. In contrast, as described in the method, the water-soluble and exchangeable element content can be inferred from the 0.1 M calcium chloride extract, thus it certainly indicates soil toxicity.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",38,2021

In this single institution, preliminary comparative case-series study we compared clinical and laboratory co-variates as well as response to tocilizumab (TCZ)-based therapy of 15 allogeneic-HSCT-and 17 COVID-19-Associated sCRS patients. Reaction to a TCZ plus posttransplant cyclophosphamide (PTCY) consolidation therapy in the allogeneic-HSCT-Associated sCRS group yielded significantly inferior long-Term outcome as compared to TCZ-based therapy in the COVID-19-Associated group (P = 0.003). We report that a TCZ followed by consolidation therapy with a Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) inhibitor given to 4 out of 8 critically ill COVID-19 patients resulted in their complete recovery. Non-selective JAK/STAT inhibitors influencing the action of several cytokines exhibit a broader effect than TCZ alone in calming down sCRS. Serum levels of cytokines and chemokines show similar changes in allogeneic-HSCT-and COVID-19-Associated sCRS with marked elevation of interleukin-6 (IL-6), regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interferon γ-induced protein 10 kDa (IP-10) levels. In addition, levels of IL-5, IL-10, IL-15 were also elevated in allogeneic-HSCT-Associated sCRS. Our multi-cytokine expression data indicate that the pathophysiology of allogeneic-HSCT and COVID-19-Associated sCRS are similar therefore the same clinical grading system and TCZ-based treatment approaches can be applied. TCZ with JAK/STAT inhibitor consolidation therapy might be highly effective in COVID-19 sCRS patients.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",77,2021

A total of 318 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales isolates were included. Most of the isolates (n = 290, 91.2%) were identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae. The most common carbapenemase type was OXA-48 (n = 82, 27.6%). CZA susceptibility was evaluated in 84 isolates with OXA-48 and KPC carbapenemase activity.

High susceptibility rates against colistin resistant isolates which generally are also pan drug resistant, makes CZA a promising therapeutic choice for difficult-To-Treat infections. Due to its high correlation with the BMD, disk diffusion method is a suitable and more practical method in detecting CZA in vitro activity.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",34,2021

The current study was undertaken to evaluate the resistance pattern, and determine the genetic types of multidrug-resistant S. aureus isolated from wound. This cross-sectional study was conducted over the period of two years (from December 2018 to November 2020) at the hospitals affiliated to Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran. In present study, 75 multidrug-resistant S. aureus isolates collected from wound infections were investigated. Phenotypic resistance was assessed by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Conventional PCR was performed for the detection of virulence encoding genes. Genotyping of strains was performed based on coa gene polymorphism using multiplex-PCR assay. SCCmec typing, spa typing and MLST were also used to characterize the genotype of the mupirocin, tigecycline and vancomycin resistant multidrug-resistant S. aureus isolates. All 75 multidrug-resistant S. aureus isolates in the study were confirmed as MRSA. Coagulase typing distinguished isolates into five genotypic patterns including III (40%), I (24%), IVb (16%), V (10.7%) and type X (9.3%). Resistance to tigecycline was detected in 4% of MDR-MRSA isolates and all belonged to CC8/ST239-SCCmec III/t421 lineage. According to our analysis, one VRSA strain was identified that belonged to coa type V and CC/ST22-SCCmec IV/t790 lineage. Resistance to mupirocin was detected in 9.3% of strains. All 7 mupirocin resistant MDR-MRSA isolates exhibited resistance to mupirocin in high level.

Our study areas were located in Békés County, one of them was near Apátfalva, about 10 km east of Makó, and the other one was 2 km northeast of Szeged in Csongrád County. Our in situ wind tunnel experiments were accomplished on 2-4 June 2011 at Apátfalva and in July 2013 in Szeged. The objectives of our research were the followings: determination of the enrichment ratios for humus, macro-and microelements in the wind eroded sediments in the case of Chernozem soils with different structures based on field experiments and laboratory measurements; determination the affecting actual soil factors; estimation of soil loss and element rearrangement trends on Chernozem arable lands under different wind velocity on plot scale. Because of the differences in the aggregate size distribution, CaCO3 and humus content, Chernozem soil near Szeged is more sensitive to deflation than near Apátfalva. Threshold friction velocity was measured between 6.5 and 9.0 m s-1 near Szeged, while the same parameter was 13.0 m s-1 at Apátfalva. The higher carbonate and humus content and the higher crumb ratio of the soil on the Apátfalva area result increasing threshold friction velocity. Due to the higher proportion of aggregates smaller than 0.5 mm in the topsoil, we have measured not only lower threshold friction velocities, but also a larger quantity of transported soil and a larger humus and phosphorus loss during the uniform 10-10 minute long wind tunnel experiments in the Szeged sample area. It can be concluded that even in spite of the same soil type and same texture there are significant differences between deflation sensitivity, threshold friction velocity, sediment transport mode, humus and nutrient transportation because of the significant differences in aggregate size distribution, CaCO3 and humus content. It means that the agronomic structure of the soils greatly influences the mitigation and aggravation of the soil the stress effects caused by climate change. Extreme weather situations have drawn attention to the fact that improperly applied cultivation methods, tools, and overuse of Chernozem soils can modify the soil structure. One of the most serious affect is the dusting of the surface layer of the soil. During this process the larger macroaggregates disintegrate into microaggregates and the resulting smaller fractions are more exposed to wind erosion. The dust load affecting our settlements is mainly originated from arable lands. The mitigation of this emission is fundamentally based on the regulation of land use, farming practices and deflation. ""Best Management Practices""(BMPs) mean a group of selected tools that can reduce or eliminate the transport of pollutants from diffuse sources before, during and/or after agricultural activities. However, these diffuse agricultural loads caused by wind erosion can only be quantified if the magnitude and spatial movement of the dust and pollutants is monitored.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",40,2021

Are there cross-linguistic similarities and differences detectable? What motivates similarity and variation across speech communities? Utilizing Fraser’s (1999) pragmatic classification of discourse markers, it is shown that the holding away gesture shows the connection of topics and messages. For both languages, we explore the functional diversity of the gesture. Some functions are found in both data sets, though the proportions differ, while others are exclusively found in one or the other. Finally, we discuss how differences in discourse type and interactional setting may facilitate specific forms and uses of the holding away gesture.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",82,2021

Children move this way primarily in stopping a co-participant’s action and protesting against the action to be stopped. The Slapping movements documented showed different manners of execution. Some forms appeared to be very expressive, others were more schematic. Inspired by a phenomenological approach to gestures our analysis shows that the movement qualities show different degrees of communicative effort and affective intensity which respond to the inter-affective dynamics unfolding between the participants of a situation. This means that the affective intensities unfolding in an interaction not only give rise to the Slapping movement, but they also influence how the hands are moved. In more detail, we observed that the higher the affective intensities become the larger and more vigorous the Slapping movements are.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",63,2021

Yet several questions about this gesture category have remained in the background. How do such gestures relate to the behavioral activities within which they occur, their wider embodied and intercorporeal context, and the relations between the people performing them? These questions are addressed by adopting an enactive approach to human relating and by analysing how the Vertical Palm gesture form materializes during an episode of gift-giving between two friends in China, where the practice involves elaborate embodied maneuvers resulting in a visibly affective ‘seesaw battle’. Treating gift-giving as a situation for participatory sense-making spun from a complex web of sensorimotor schemes, this seesaw battle provides a natural ecology for exploring understudied dimensions of the Vertical Palm recurrent gesture as embodied, embedded, and enacted during a practice with culturally-specific dimensions.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",61,2021

The shrug in its full-fledged form can combine a palm-up, lifted shoulders, a head tilt, raised eyebrows and a mouth shrug (Kendon, 2004; Streeck, 2009). All formal components and functions of the two children’s shrugs between the ages of 1 and 4;2 were coded within the multimodal ongoing discourse. Multiple correspondence analyses were combined with detailed qualitative analyses. Despite differences in the two children, interesting similarities in the development were observed over three periods: (1) absence is mainly expressed with palm-ups; (2) both children start using head tilts and shoulder lifts to express epistemicity and interpersonal positioning; (3) head tilts increase, and each body part is more clearly associated with one function.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",55,2021

We aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying this resistance. A total of 24 multi-drug resistant isolates of K. pneumoniae were included in the study. The phenotypic determination of carbapenemase presence was based on the CARBA NP test. NG-Test CARBA 5 was also performed, and it showed KPC production in 22 out 24 strains. The molecular characterisation of bla KPC carbapenemase gene, ESBL genes (bla CTX-M, bla TEM, and bla SHV) and porin genes ompK35/36 was performed using the PCR. Finally, ILLUMINA sequencing was performed to determine the presence of genetic mutations. Various types of mutations in the KPC sequence, leading to ceftazidime/avibactam resistance, were detected in the analysed resistant strains. We observed that KPC-31 harboured the D179Y mutation, the deletion of the amino acids 167-168, and the mutation of T243M associated with ceftazidime/avibactam resistance. The isolates that did not present carbapenemase alterations were found to have other mechanisms such as mutations in the porins. The mutations both on the KPC-3 enzyme and in the porins confirmed, that diverse mechanisms confer resistance to ceftazidime/avibactam in K. pneumoniae.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",13,2021

All rights reserved.Introduction: Pulpal and periapical infections are initiated by microorganisms when they gain access to the dental pulp. The success of root canal treatment principally depends on the eradication of the microorganisms in the root canal system. The aim of this study was to evaluate the viable microbial profile of root canals with various stages of infection in Ghanaians. Material and Methods: Forty-four consecutive patients with sixty teeth referred to the Restorative Dentistry Clinic requiring root canal treatment were recruited. Root canal samples were collected from the teeth with sterile paper points. The samples were processed and subjected to microbial analysis and identification using Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS). Results: A total of 259 isolates were recovered from the 60 infected root canals, belonging to twenty different microbial genera. Out of the 259 microbial species isolated, only two were Candida albicans, a fungi; 257 (99.2%) were bacterial isolates belonging to 19 genera. The 19 genera encompassed 53 bacterial species, out of which 26 (49.1%) were identified as facultative anaerobes, 15 (28.3 %.) as obligate anaerobes and 12 (22.6%) were aerobes. Streptococcus species (Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus constellatus) were the most predominant isolates, followed by Prevotella sp, Actinomyces sp, Enterococcus faecalis and Rothia sp respectively. Conclusion: The findings of this study show that infected root canals are polymicrobial in nature. The determination of the microbial profile aids in understanding the pathogenesis of pulpal and periradicular infections and helps in choosing effective antimicrobial irrigation and medicament for root canal treatment.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",23,2021

Objective: To determine how the sociodemographic characteristics of the elderly in a city of Arequipa (Peru) are associated with Oral Health-related Quality of Life (OHRQoL). Material and Methods: A descriptive, prospective, cross-sectional study consisting of 240 older adults, was carried out between October and December of 2019. Sociodemographic characteristics were assessed by means of a questionnaire, while oral health-related quality of life was evaluated using the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14). A descriptive analysis was performed to study the distribution of oral health-related quality of life and sociodemographic characteristics. An inferential analysis was performed to determine the association between the study variables. Results: Most of the older adults were aged between 60-65 years (32.1%). Female participants were the most prevalent group accounting for 60.8%; 42.5% had completed secondary education; 45.4% were married; and 46.7% were covered by a Comprehensive Health Insurance system (SIS, for its acronym in Spanish); 42.9% lived in a extended-family household; and more than half of the respondents reported an income below the minimum living wage (64.2%). Most of the older adults perceived that their oral health did not have a negative impact on their quality of life, with excellent (45.4%) and moderate (34.6%) assessments of their oral health-related quality of life. The most affected dimensions were psychological discomfort (84.2%) and functional limitation (72.1%). Age, educational level, marital status, type of insurance, and level of income had a statistically significant relationship with oral health-related quality of life (p<0.05).

Objective: To determine the oral health-related quality of life in adults who received dental care at establishments managed by the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare of Paraguay, the School of Dentistry of Universidad Nacional de Asunción, and the “Chacarita” Community Center, in Paraguay, in the first quarter of 2017. Material and Methods: A crosssectional study was carried out. The Paraguayan version of the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14Py) was used. Spearman's correlation, Kruskal-Wallis, and Mann-Whitney tests were used to relate the impact of oral health with demographic, labor, educational, and clinical variables. Results: 333 subjects participated in the study. The most affected domains were physical pain, psychological distress, and psychological disability. The correlation between OHIP-14Py and DMF-T was positive but poor (r=0.236; p=<0.001). The oral health-related quality of life was significantly lower in subjects with abnormal oral mucosa (p=0.020), presence of TMJ symptoms (p=0.026), need for prostheses (p<0.001), higher level of severity of DMF-T (p<0.001), use of upper (p=0.004) and lower (p<0.001) prostheses, and absence of functional dentition (p<0.001).

All rights reserved.Introduction: Chemotherapy can lead to an imbalance in the ecosystem of the oral cavity, allowing the development of mucositis in the immunosuppression phase due to interaction with microbial agents. The objective of this study was to identify bacterial and fungal species that contribute to oral complications in patients undergoing marrow translantation and compare their susceptibility to various antimicrobial agents before and during the immunosuppression period. Material and Methods: This observational-longitudinal study was performed on 18 patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation from the Oncohematology Service of Sanatorio Allende (2018/2019), with buccal mucosa swabs before treatment (I) and mid-stage (M), fourteen days after transplantation. The samples were cultured in selective media for Streptococcus and fungal species and a susceptibility study was performed on Müller Hinton agar. Results: At (I), 82.30% of patients were found to be positive for Streptococcus mutans, 11.30% for Streptococcus salivarius, 5.50% for Streptococcus sobrinus and 9.40% grew mixed commensal microorganisms. At (M), 96.60% were positive for Streptococcus mutans and 23.10% for Streptococcus salivarius, without any growth of Streptococcus sobrinus or mixed microorganisms. In (I), a 27.00% incidence of Candida albicans was observed, while in (M) the incidence was 73.00%. The antibiotics to which the microorganisms were most sensitive in (I) were vancomycin (88.80%), amikacin (83.30%), amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (78.00%), ciprofloxacin (77.75%) and azithromycin (66.60%). In (M) sensitivity to amikacin was 92.30%, vancomycin, 76.90%; amoxicillin + clavulanic acid, 38.50%; azithromycin, 23.10%; and ciprofloxacin, 15.40%. A statistically significant prevalence of Streptococcus mutans was observed in comparison to other species. Conclusion: During the immunosuppression period, there was a significant increase in Candida albicans. The antibiotics to which the bacteria were most sensitive were amikacin and, to a lesser extent, vancomycin, showing significant resistance to ciprofloxacin, azithromycin and amoxicillin + clavulanic acid.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",25,2021

Although fatal once clinical signs appear, rabies is preventable through three proven, effective interventions including mass dog vaccination, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), and, though sometimes neglected, awareness of rabies. What is added by this report? The total awareness rate of rabies-related knowledge among rural residents was only 57.9% in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, one of the provincial-level administrative divisions (PLADs) with endemic rabies in China, and the exposure rate of dog-bite injuries was as high as 7.2% in the past year. In addition, 14.8% of bite victims failed to seek PEP service. What are the implications for public health practice? This study can provide evidence for the targeted prevention and control program of rabies in rural areas and help realize the international goals of eliminating dog-mediated rabies by 2030.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",12,2021

All rights reserved.Background Pulmonary toxicity due to chemotherapeutic agents can occur with many established and new drugs. Strong clinical suspicion is important as the clinical presentation is usually with nonspecific symptoms like cough, dyspnea, fever, and pulmonary infiltrates. Timely discontinuation of the offending agent alone can improve the condition. Methods A prospective observational study on patients receiving chemotherapy at an 800-bedded tertiary care hospital was performed from 2014 to 2016. Consecutive patients on chemotherapy, presenting with nonresolving respiratory symptoms were evaluated with contrast-enhanced computerized tomography of chest, diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO), fiberoptic bronchoscopy with lavage, and biopsy, after excluding all causes for pulmonary infections. Descriptive data has been depicted. Results A total of 18 patients were evaluated for persistent symptoms of dry cough, dyspnea, and fever among 624 who received chemotherapy during the study period. Ground-glass opacities on high-resolution CT was the most common imaging finding, others being patchy subpleural consolidation and pleural effusion. Lymphocyte-predominant bronchoalveolar lavage was detected in nine. Eight of the 15 patients who underwent DLCO, had abnormal results. Seven had significant histopathological findings on bronchoscopic lung biopsy, which revealed organizing pneumonia as the most common pattern. Paclitaxel, fluorouracil, gemcitabine, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors were the common culprit drugs. Discontinuation alone of the culprit drug was effective in 15 and 3 needed oral corticosteroids for relief of symptoms. None of the patients died due to the toxicity. Conclusion An incidence of 2.8% for chemotherapy-induced lung injury was seen in our observational study of 3 years, with parenchymal, interstitial, and pleural involvement due to various chemotherapeutic agents. Oral steroids maybe required in a subset of patients not responding to discontinuation of the culprit agent.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",24,2021

It has been observed that this connection has weakened since the financial crisis and it was suggested that the so called Weighted Average Cost of Liabilities (WACL) might be a better proxy for the banks' marginal costs than the prime rate or interbank rate. In this study the WACL for Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania is calculated by applying cointegration tests and ARDL models. I examined whether their long-run relationships with the retail loan rates are more stable. Results: 1. Using the WACL instead of the interbank rate yields slightly more stable long-term relationships with the retail loan rates, and the WACL has been proved to be somewhat more stable than the interbank rate. 2. The interest rate pass-through has been efficient for the household loan rates in all three countries, but only in Romania for the corporate loan rates. 3. The results suggest that the central banks can effectively influence the commercial banks' financing costs even in a low interest rate environment, although this cost represents only one component of the loan rates, and the movements of other components can offset the changes of the prime rate.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",32,2021

However, not much attention is given to the impact of these technologies, reputation, and pre-visit experiences on loyalty intentions. The purpose of this study was to investigate the direct effects of 4IR, Vilakazi Street precinct reputation, and customers’ pre-visit experience on customers’ loyalty intentions (LOYALT). It also investigates the mediating effect of reputation and pre-visit experience on the 4IR-LOYALT relationship. The study followed the quantitative approach, using the primary data collected from tourists (N=235) who visited the Vilakazi Street precinct between October and November 2019. Smart PLS SEM approach was used to analyse the data. The study confirmed positive direct relationships between 4IR, REPUT, and PREVISIT on loyalty intentions. In addition, reputation and customers’ pre-visit experiences were also shown to mediate the relationship between the 4IR and loyalty intentions positively. The study provides a framework using constructs embedded in TAM and TPB theories, which extends the applications of these theories. The framework provides an additional tool for further investigations of the way to improve chances of predicting tourists’ responses to innovations, and it can also be used to explain the adoption of technology in different industries.

The disease can be influenced by various sociodemographic factors and can manifest as clinical, pulmonary and gastrointestinal symptoms. This study used an artificial neural network (ANN) model with important sociodemographic factors as well as clinical, pulmonary and gastrointestinal symptoms to screen patients for COVID-19. Patients themselves can screen for these symptoms at home. Methods Data on all registered patients were extracted in autumn. The best ANN model was selected from different combinations of connections, some hidden layers and some neurons in each hidden layer. In this study, 70% of the data were used in the network training process and the remaining 30% were used to evaluate the function of the multilayer, feed-forward, back-propagation algorithm. Results The sensitivity and specificity of the ANN model in diagnosing patients with COVID-19 were 94.5% and 17.4%. In order of priority, clinical symptoms, sociodemographic factors, pulmonary symptoms and gastrointestinal symptoms were important predictive factors for COVID-19 using the ANN model. Screening patients for COVID-19 using clinical symptoms and sociodemographic factors (80% importance) remains essential. Conclusions Home monitoring of oxygen saturation and body temperature as well as old age and drug addiction can be helpful in self-screening symptoms of COVID-19 at home, thereby preventing unnecessary visits to medical centres and reducing burden on medical services.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",15,2021

Focal points of such product-oriented error annotation include language mechanics (punctuation, grammar, lexis and syntax, for example) and various kinds of transfer errors. In recent years, screen recording technology has opened new doors for empirically informing translation assessment from a more process-oriented perspective (Massey and Ehrensberger-Dow, 2014; Angelone, 2019). Screen recording holds particular promise when tracing errors documented in the product back to potential underlying triggers in the form of processes that co-occur on screen in their presence. Assessor observations made during screen recording analysis can give shape to process-oriented error categories that parallel and complement product-oriented categories. This paper proposes a series of empirically informed, process-oriented error categories that can be used for assessing translations in contexts where screen recordings are applied as a diagnostic tool. The categories are based on lexical and semantic patterns derived from a corpus-based analysis of think-aloud protocols documenting articulations made by assessors when commenting on errors made in student translations while watching screen recordings of their work. It is hoped that these process-oriented error categories will contribute to a more robust means by which to assess and classify errors in translation.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",19,2021

Today as yesterday, the insatiable hunger of the creative genius characterizes the poietic activity of certain artists and architects who see the world in an imaginative way in order to give birth to original pieces of reality (or unreality). Reason and imagination freely interact in the artistic mind, decomposing and recomposing fragments of architectures, urban and natural landscapes to build new visions. The history of art is full of examples of visionary artists whose production was mainly devoted to the visionary representation of places such as the Baroque scenic designs by the Galli da Bibiena dynasty, the imaginary views by Piranesi and the masters of capriccio as well as the futuristic visions of Sant’Elia and Chernikhov. Similar experimentations can be found today in the work of environment concept artists operating in the entertainment industry: These artists create depictions of fictional universes characterized by an extraordinary evocative power, in which reality and imagination coexist.

Fourteen syntactic complexity indices were examined based on a one-million-word translational English corpus (COTE) and a one-million-word non-translational English corpus (i.e. FLOB), respectively. This study shows that syntactic explicitation in translations varies with the formality of discourse. The most significant complexity difference between translational vis-à-vis non-translational English is found in fiction, which is regarded as the major contributor to translational English syntactic complexity. No significant difference in syntactic complexity was observed between the two types of academic English texts. Translational English news and general prose stand between fiction and academic texts. Translational fiction and news are characterised by more phrasal complexity features such as coordinate and complex nominal phrases, and a key indicator of translational English general prose complexity is subordination. The findings of this study will help students of translation to make informed decisions on the arrangement of sentence structures when given texts of different genres.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",32,2021

As evidence of the prevalence of PP in Hungary, the study highlights that the number of Hungarian positive psychological publications surveyed in 2012 tripled by 2020, with a spectacular increase in the number of young researchers working on PP topics and PhD dissertations on PP topics. PP at all levels of university education (BA, MA, Doctoral training) has been included in the curriculum. There is also an increasing supply of books compiled from works written by Hungarian experts, from which we can learn about the practical application of PP in various branches of psychology.

The emphasis in this research is on the linguistic analysis of the translations of cultural, social and historical realia referred to as Sovietisms, which pertain to items characteristic of Soviet discourse in the 1930s. Bulgakov's language is brimming with Soviet vocabulary that refers to various cultural and socio-political elements of Soviet reality. A complete naturalization or even omission of Sovietisms may lead to loss of connotative meanings essential to understanding the context, while foreignizing through transliteration or calquing may disturb the fluency of reading. The purpose of the analysis is to assess the translators' choices and what they imply for the readers. Another aim is to test the assumptions of re-translation theory (Bensimon 1990; Gambier 1994), which states that early translations are more target-oriented than subsequent translations. The analysis employs taxonomies suggested by Vlakhov and Florin (1980) and Mokienko and Nikitina (1998) for the classification of Sovietisms, and Aixela's taxonomy of translation strategies (1996) as the grounds for the case study.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",6,2021

Athanasius Kircher's research between interpretation and resolution of reality,Disegno,"[('Università degli Studi di Sassari', 'Sassari', 'Italy')]","© 2021, UID Unione Italiana Disegno. All rights reserved.The figure of the German Jesuit Athanasius Kircher (1602-1680) is significant within the graphic culture emerging in 17th century Europe. His writings, richly drawn, and his research, in the whole Baroque spirit, are strongly characterised using hermetic and neo-Platonic philosophies. These become an opportunity to build a bridge between medieval systems of thought and the growing empirical movement of the scientific revolution. The essay aims to demonstrate the richness of Kircher's study, capable on the one hand of grasping the connections of a nascent scientific thought and on the other of pushing the imaginative power of drawing to its limits. This dual nature-of science and representation-is investigated by bringing out the role of drawing in the representation of reality. Where what can be directly observed coexists on the same plane with what can only be imagined. The research highlights the crucial passage between the dimension of the circle and that of the ellipse. The former represents the certainty of the Renaissance man, the latter-Kircher's one- highlights the unstable and dialectical nature of Baroque knowledge. It is precisely in the shadows of the Jesuit's thought that we rediscover the connective power of his thinking, which is most evident in the visionary dimension of his drawings.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",26,2021

The Polish tourism industry is also dramatically affected by the ongoing pandemic, with a 30% drop in the number of tourists in July 2020 compared to July 2019. The global lockdown has limited the functioning of the tourism sector, therefore domestic tourism, including urban tourism, may rise in importance. Domestic urban tourism can become a useful response to the growing resilience of the tourism industry, for example in the context of reducing dependence between the tourism industry and mobility which favours the spread of coronavirus. The potential of urban tourism in Poland is clearly visible (in 2019, it was three times higher than rural tourism in terms of overnight stays provided). However, the COVID-19 pandemic is not conducive to urban tourism in Poland, for instance, because infections are much more frequent in cities than in rural areas. The aim of the research, in addition to checking destinations of Poles in the context of urban tourism in the era of the pandemic, was to learn about the behaviour of tourists during their holiday trips. To achieve the aim of the paper, the study was conducted from 16 to 31 August 2020, using CAWI survey method, among people who visited Polish cities starting from May 2020 through the end of August 2020 (following the partial lifting of restrictions). The research indicated, despite the threat, the popularity of the largest tourist destinations in Poland. It also indicated that the behaviour and decisions of tourists were not different from those before the pandemic.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",41,2021

It can be assumed that one ofthe underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon is that these children are exposed to an increased amount of adverse stress throughout their lives. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between the components of socioeconomic status and executive functions in a Hungarian sample of preschool children, and the role ofcortisol hormone levels (as an indicator of stress) in this regard. Methods: We recruited a socioeconomically diverse sample of children from four different preschools. The analyses reported in the present study were performed based on data from 76 participants (45 male, 31 female, a.ge mnge 52-83 months, mean age 70,85 months). Information regarding the socioeconomic status was collected from parents by questionnaires, children's executive functions were measured by computerized neuropsychological tests (Corsi Block, Go/No-Go, Hearts and Flowers), and their stress level was assessed by cortisol hormone levels from saliva samples (morning sampling, measured by ELISA method). Results: Our results are in line with previous findings showing that it is only parental education that has a significant relationship with the executive functions ofchildren, while family income does not. In addition, cortisol hormone levels were found to partially mediate the relationship between parental educational level and children's executive function capacities. Conclusions: We can conclude that increased stress is one of the mechanisms through which socioeconomic status influences children's cognitive skills, but other factors may also be determinants.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",65,2021

All rights reserved.In the Church of St. Anastasia, in Verona, Italy, there is a fresco from Pisanello, dated between 1432 and 1438. It is named San Giorgio e la Principessa (St. George and the Princess), but it has received in time the final addition “of Trebisonda”. The vision depicted inside this fresco opens a reflection about interpretation and representation, about resolution and dissolution of reality. The work of representation can be a way of visualizing an idea or a place from which there is just a vision coming from the words of others. No matter how uncertain it is, the vision of the author leads to the definition of the result, capturing myths and fascinations, like ‘the East’, ‘the city far away’, ‘Trebisonda’, ‘the travel’. The traces inserted in the artwork may contain a specific code, later (mis)interpreted in a new cultural scenario. The idea of Pisanello depicting the city on the Black Sea is not supported by resolutive evidence. It seems like a weird alchemy pushing ideas. In this paper, a ‘state of the knowledge’ about this artwork will be the frame for a reflection about the visionary contents and elements in the main scene and in the background. A test operated with a group of architecture students and artists will investigate what happens when representing a city in a landscape seen only through oral communication. A graphic and logical matching between the ideal representation of the city in the fresco and the past and present Trebisonda/Trebizond/Trabzon will complete the analysis.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",27,2021

In the technical sphere, Piranesi went beyond the limit during his incessant experimentation to get the secret of etching to which he aspired. The price he had to pay to achieve the freedom, poetry and freshness of sign, with which he expressed the power, depth and audacity of his imagination, concerned some technical failures found on the copper matrices. His overcoming the limits in the field of perspective is demonstrated by the expedients with which Piranesi skilfully mastered perspective to adapt the composition to his aesthetic and expressive wishes, anticipating and synthesising modern cinematographic techniques in a single image. In architecture, the overcoming of limits can be found in his inventions: In the impossible configurations of the Carceri and the colossal architectural fantasies collected in the Opere varie.

However, limited number of complex, non-suicidal self-injurious behavior screening questionnaires exist. Therefore, the main aim of our research was to introduce a detailed self-injury questionnaire, the Hungarian version ofthe Inventory of Statements About Self-Injury (ISAS-HU) into the Hungarian test system. Methods: High school students (N=1015; 66.1% girls (N=671); mean age was 16.81; SD=1.42) filled out questionnaires on emotion regulation, mental health aspects, and self-injurious behaviours. Results: Nearly 60% ofthe adolescents (58.8%; N=597) have never, while 41.2% (N=418) have alrea,dy enga.ged in self-harm at least once in their life. Thirty two percent of the whole sample (N=322) engaged in self-harm in the previous month. Girls are at one and a half times greater risk for self-harm than boys. Adolescents who have never engaged in self-harm enjoyed the best psychological health. We provide further descriptives of attitudinal components of self-harm behaviour. Exploratory Structural Equation Modeling, which allows cross-loadings of the items, strengthened the original two-factor structure of the second part of the ISAS-HU; an intrapersonal and an interpersonal function factor emerged with good reliability.

A group of students (N = 23) took part in the study. The study consisted of three parts: an English reading span test, a sight translation task, and a baseline reading task. During the sight translation task, the participants sight translated English sentences with different degrees of structural asymmetry into Chinese in the single sentence context and the discourse context. During the baseline reading task, they silently read the English sentences and answered the comprehension questions. The participants' eye movements in the sight translation and baseline reading tasks were recorded as indicators of cognitive load. Three major findings were generated: (1) Syntactic complexity resulted in a significant increase in cognitive load during the sight translation task. The syntactic aspects of the target language were activated during the initial stage of comprehension, which favoured the parallel view of translation. (2) Although sight translation became more time efficient due to wider contexts, a larger amount of contextual information did not make word-based processing less effortful, as indicated by more fixations and the longer regression path duration in the discourse context. (3) No correlations were found between reading span and cognitive load in addressing syntactical complexity.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",89,2021

All rights reserved.The selection-optimization-compensation model assumes flexible adaptation processes by which the elderly are able to achieve a positive balance between gains and losses of their lives. The Selection-Optimization-Compensation (SOC-12) questionnaire was developed to measure these strategies. Aim: The aim of our research was to adapt the SOC-12 questionnaire to Hungarian language and to establish its psychometric properties. Methods: Our cross-sectional research was conducted on a sample of 155 people aged 60 and over (mean age: 74.6 years, SD = 7.9 years, range: 60-98 years; gender distribution: 125 (81%) women and 30 (19%) male). Measures: SOC-12 Questionnaire, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Geriatric Depression Scale Short Form. Results: Based on our results, the fit of the original 4 factor structure of the SOC-12 questionnaire very weak. Exploratory factor analysis revealed a two-factor structure. The items of factor 1, which represent the whole of the SOC-12 scale (containing items from all subscales), form a scale with good reliability (McDonald's ω [95% CI]: 0,83 [0,79-0,87]. In the case of the subscale created from the items loading on the factor 2, the ω-value [95% CI] is 0.56 [0.43-0.69], so its reliability is less than acceptable. Both convergent and divergent validity of the modified SOC questionnaire is optimal, supporting the validity of the resource use strategies measured by the scale. Conclusions: Based on the current study, the original SOC-12 questionnaire had to be modified. Our results support that the modified questionnaire makes measurable adaptation processes in old age. Independent measurement of selection strategies is not possible due to low reliability items. The scale provides a short, easy response to measure these strategies, and both completion and evaluation take a short time.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",53,2021

All rights reserved.Like other social relationships (e.g., parental, sibling), friendship can also be interpreted along functions, the existence and functioning of which fundamentally determine the development of a friendship. Based on the previous research (e.g., Zimmermann, 2004) from the age of 13-14, friendship also means a relationship that provides emotional security and intimacy for young people, which greatly helps commitment to the other. Aim: The aim of the empirical study was to explore the functions of same-sex and opposite-sex friendship among 12-13- (Year 6) and 16-17-year-olds (Year 10) (N = 304). To explore perceptions of friendship functions, we adapted an English-language questionnaire (McGill Friendship Questionnaire, MFQ, Mendelson & Aboud, 2014), which has so far been used primarily to examine characteristics of same-sex friends. This questionnaire has not analyzed the friendship of adolescents in Hungary. Methods: The MFQ was adapted to measure friendship functions. The 30 statements are grouped into six factors: stimulating companionship, help, intimacy, emotional security, reliable alliance, self-validation. Results: Based on the results of the exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis (Year 6same-sex: χ2 = 668.95, df = 390, p < .001, RMSEA = .08, CFI = .79, TLI = .78, SRMR = .08; Year 6opposite-sex: χ2 = 658.52, df = 390, p < .001, RMSEA = .08, CFI = .81, TLI = .78, SRMR = .08; Year10same-sex: χ2 = 683.89, df = 390, p < 0.001, RMSEA = .07, CFI = .81, TLI = .79, SRMR = .07; Year 10opposite-sex: χ2 = 699.08 , df = 390, p < .001, RMSEA = .07, CFI = .86, TLI = .85, SRMR = .06), the Hungarian version of the MFQ (26-items) can be used to measure adolescents, but in the case of opposite-sex friendships, further factor analysis will be required on a larger sample. The reliability indices of the MFQ variants are adequate (Cronbach-α: .69-.88). According to the hypotheses formulated based upon previous research, among the functions measured by MFQ, 16-17-year-olds are significantly (p < .05) more characterised by friend's performance and positives frequent recognition of both same- and opposite-sex friends (same-sex: Year 6: M = 5.94, SD = 1.23, Year 10: M = 6.28, SD = 1.28, MWU = 7994, p < 0.001; opposite-sex: Year 6: M = 5.71, SD = 1.61, Year 10: M = 6.29, SD = 1.28, MWU = 3889, p < 0.001), and the older adolescents are characterized by intimacy in the case of opposite-sex friends (opposite-sex, Year 6: M = 6.24, SD = 1.88, Year 10: M = 6.79, SD = 1.43, MWU = 4515, p = 0.044). We also identified several gender differences among the elder ones (p < .05): for girls, all functions play a more significant role in friendship, except for recognition in the case of same-sex friendship, but in the case of opposite-sex relationships, girls only stimulate coexistence and endurance was rated as more characteristic. Conclusions: In addition to confirming the age and gender-associated peculiarity known from previous research, the results raise the possibility that the functions are organized hierarchically along with age. We will have the opportunity to examine this, as well as some other methodological issues, in the second (2021) and third (2022) years of the longitudinal study.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",33,2021

Although it has been primarily used for testing clinical populations, and various forms of the scale have been created, only a small body of literature has proved its psychometric adequacy on a clinical sample. Goals: Therefore, the current study aims to construct an updated, reliable and brief version of the DAS. Methods: For this purpose, besides the normal samples of adolescents (n = 195) and adults (n = 270), a heterogeneous clinical sample (n = 1077) was involved in cross-sectional research. Results: The overall results of parallel analysis and exploratory factor analysis suggested a bifactor structure with a general factor and three extracted subfactors (Dependence, Perfectionism and Entitlement), comprising 14 items altogether (χ2 = 157.26, DF = 63, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.970, TLI = 0.957, RMSEA = 0.036, RMSEA CI90 = 0.029-0.044). Convergent validity was tested by correlations with Beck Depression Inventory (r = 0.36, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Our study was based on the largest clinical sample in the field of psychometric analysis of the DAS so far. The findings suggest that DAS14 as a brief version of the original DAS has good psychometric properties, and it can be widely used as a measurement tool in the assessment of mood disorders.

The scope of the study was to investigate the relationship between the amount of malondialdehyde equivalents (MDA) and CIELAB colour coordinates in a Hungarian sausage with paprika, sliced and stored under refrigerated conditions for 10 weeks. We detected negative correlation (P < 0.001) between the MDA-level and a* and b*; and positive correlation (P < 0.001) between the MDA-level and L*. The observed correlation between MDA level and colour coordinates supports the assumption that the oxidation of lipids and pigments are interrelated in the case of sausage with paprika.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",14,2021

All rights reserved.In the present study, microstructure, hardness, and abrasion resistance of a heat-treated high carbon-high chromium steel (FMU-11) used in the cement mills were investigated. To investigate the best heat-treating cycle for the FMU-11 steel, three sets of samples were heat treated. The first set was tempered two times, the second set was re-hardened, and the third set was cryogenically heat treated. These samples were then compared with the conventionally heat-treated samples. The samples' microstructure was studied using an optical microscope, where traditional black and white etching, as well as color etching, were used. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was applied for higher magnification studies and in-depth analysis of the chemical composition. The mechanical properties were investigated by measuring the hardness and the wear resistance for the samples heat-treated in different cycles. The results showed that the cryogenic treatment and double-tempered samples had the highest hardness and wear resistance. In addition, the results showed that the re-hardening operation caused the carbides to be finely separated and evenly distributed in the steel matrix. The wear test results illustrated that the wear mechanism could be the delamination wear and the abrasive wear combined.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",41,2021

Study Design: Comparative cross-sectional study. Place and Duration of Study: Armed Forces Institute of Ophthalmology, Rawalpindi, from Sep 2019 to Dec 2020. Methodology: The sample population comprised of 80 subjects which included 40 cases of chronic serous chorio-retinopathy and 40 controls. Chronic serous chorio-retinopathy was diagnosed by consultant ophthalmologist on basis of fluorescein angiography and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Peripheral retinal examination was done among all the study participants to look for lattice degeneration. Pearson chi-square test was applied to look for the relationship of various factors with lattice degeneration including the presence of chronic serous chorio-retinopathy. Results: Two groups with equal number of subjects were included in the study. Mean age of the study participants was 49.14 ± 2.93 years. 60 (75.0%) participants were male while 20 (25%) were female. Fifty-four (67.5%) had no lattice degeneration while 26 (32.5%) showed the presence of lattice degeneration on detailed ophthalmic examination. Chi-square test showed that having chronic serous chorio-retinopathy and use of steroids were statistically significantly associated with presence of lattice degeneration among the study participants. Conclusion: Chronic serous chorio-retinopathy emerged as a condition strongly associated with lattice degeneration of peripheral retina. Use of topical or systemic steroids also increased the chances of developing lattice degeneration in our study population.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",18,2021

However, the program has faced many controversies such as intentional logging of only high-valued timber species like Shorea robusta. In addition, few believe this program is severely affecting the regeneration productivity and species diversity in the natural forests. In order to address these issues, we examined the regeneration condition and plant species diversity in the stands where scientific forest management operations were carried out. The data related to regeneration status and species diversity were collected using a systematic random sampling of the selected stands. Our results showed good regeneration conditions (Seedling >5000, Sapling>2000) in all the studied stands. The tree species community was dominated by S. robusta (Sal) followed by Schleichera oleosa (Kusum) and Casia fistula (Rajbriksha). The value of diversity indices of different species varied significantly between felling series. The highest diversity was found in the second year felling series with the Simpsons Index of dominance value 0. 6934 and the lowest species diversity was in the first year felling series with a value of 0. 8448.

All rights reserved.The mathematical SIR model generalisation for description of the infectious process dynamics development by adding a testing model is considered. The proposed procedure requires the expansion of states’ space dimension due to variables that cannot be measured directly, but allow you to more adequately describe the processes that occur in real situations. Further generalisation of the SIR model is considered by taking into account randomness in state estimates, forecas-ting, which is achieved by applying the stochastic differential equations methods associated with the application of the Fokker – Planck – Kolmogorov equations for posterior probabilities. As COVID-19 practice has shown, the widespread use of modern means of identification, diagnosis and monitoring does not guarantee the receipt of adequate information about the individual’s condition in the population. When modelling real epidemic processes in the initial stages, it is advisable to use heuristic modelling methods, and then refine the model using mathematical modelling methods using stochastic, uncertain-fuzzy methods that allow you to take into account the fact that flow, decision-making and control occurs in systems with incomplete information. To develop more realistic models, spatial kinetics must be taken into account, which, in turn, requires the use of systems models with distributed parameters (for example, models of continua mechanics). Obviously, realistic models of epidemics and their control should include models of economic, sociodyna-mics. The problems of forecasting epidemics and their development will be no less difficult than the problems of climate change forecasting, weather forecast and earthquake prediction.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",11,2021

Methods Data were obtained from the National Institute of Statistics (INE) for 1992–2019, using International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 and ICD-10 codes, by sex, age group and cause (unintentional; water transport and intentional). GBD unintentional drowning data were obtained online. Age-standardised drowning rates were calculated and compared. Results INE data showed 6057 drowning deaths, 4327 classified as unintentional (75.2% male; 36.7% 35–64 years; 31.5% 65+years; 15.2% 0–19 years). Following 2001, an increase in accidental drowning mortality and corresponding decrease in undetermined intent was observed, coincident with Portugal’s ICD-10 implementation. GBD modelled estimates followed a downward trend at an overall rate of decrease of −0.41/decade (95% CI (−0.45 to –0.37); R2adj=0.94; p<0.05). Conversely, INE data showed an increase in the rate of drowning deaths over the last decade (0.35/ decade; 95% CI (−0.18 to 0.89)). GBD estimates were significantly different from the INE dataset (alpha=0.05), either underestimating as much as 0.567*INE in 1996 or overestimating as much as 1.473*INE in 2011. Conclusions While GBD mortality data estimates are valuable in the absence of routinely collected data, they smooth variations, concealing key advocacy opportunities. Investment in country-level drowning registries enables in-depth analysis of incident circumstances. Such data are essential to informing National Water Safety Plans.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",45,2021

All rights reserved.Objective: Management of patients who presented with blackstone poisoning/Paraphenylenediamine (PPD). Study Design: Observational descriptive study. Place and Duration of Study: ENT Head and Neck Surgery Department, Jinnah Post Graduate Medical Center (JPMC) Karachi, from Jan 2019 to Dec 2020. Methodology: Proforma was designed to collect data for the study. Patients and/or attendants were asked questions regar-ding PPD ingestion reason, evidence of poison ingestion, symptoms, color, and route and time interval to reach hospital. All of the collected were entered in SPSS and analyzed using SPSS version 21. Descriptive statistics in terms of mean ± standard deviation or frequencies with percentages were computed to summarize the collected data as appropriate. Result: Total 44 patients came to emergency department with diagnosis of black stone (kalapathar poisoning) as evident by patient or by attendant. Out of them 29 patients were female (65.9%). Majority of patients 35 (79.54%) were age between 15-30 years Most of the patients 41 (93.18%) took more than 2 hours to reach hospital patients were of age between 41-50 years. Forty-two (95.5%) out of 44 ingested PPD with an intention to suicide while only 2 (4.5%) patients ingested PPD accidentally. Forty patients (90%) had severe tongue and neck swelling and underwent emergency tracheostomy while on the other hand, only 4 patients (9.09%) presented with minor tongue swelling and cervicofacial edema impending stridor clinically. Out of these 4 patients, 2 further underwent emergency tracheostomy. Conclusion: Paraphenylenediamine poisoning is commonly used in Pakistan for suicidal purpose especially in females as its easily available and cheap. All of the patients need Emergency tracheostomy due to angioneurotic edema leads to asphyxia. Therefore, we need to spread awareness so that its availability should be banned and Psychiatrists should do counseling of such patients for their mental health.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2021

In this study, Mediterranean mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) were exposed for 7 days to Cd and three Cd-mixtures (Cd+Pb, Cd+Cu and Cd+Pb+Cu). The accumulation and tissue distribution of inorganic elements (Ca, K, Mg, Na, P and S, macrominerals) that are usually not taken into consideration in field studies on in bioassays were evaluated. Regarding concentration, the element which differed the most with respect to the control group was K, while Mg was the only one which showed no significant statistical difference with the control group. The group exposed to ternary mixture was the one in which there were more alterations in concentration and distribution of these macrominerals with respect to control, whereas in the group exposed to single Cd no significant differences in the concentration of these inorganic elements were found. The concentration and distribution of macrominerals in the compartments studied (digestive gland, gill and remaining soft tissues) is susceptible to the presence of Cd and heavy metal Cd-mixtures, with percentages of changes until 28.7%. Study results suggest that macrominerals composition in mussel tissues could be useful in studies of heavy metal contamination in marine ecosystems.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",52,2021

All rights reserved.Manuscript type: Research paper Research aims: This paper aims to examine how the political effectiveness and board independence moderate the effect of managerial entrenchment on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Design/Methodology/Approach: Data of non-financial firms from the BRICS countries for the period of 2010-2018 were obtained from Thomson Reuters (asset 4) and financial reports. Panel regression model was employed to analyse the data. Research findings: The results show that there is a positive relationship between managerial entrenchment and CSR. Political embeddedness was found to strengthen the positive relationship between managerial entrenchment and CSR. Independent directors was reported to weaken the relationship between managerial entrenchment and CSR. Theoretical contribution/Originality: Theoretically, this study contributes to the literature on agency theory. The finding provides novel insights into how managerial entrenchment affects CSR activities. It also expands the body of knowledge on corporate governance and CSR by focusing on manager’s self-interest to shareholder’s interest. Practitioner/Policy implication: Practically, this study provides valuable information to stakeholders, regulatory authorities and investors who wish to assess various antecedents of CSR. Research limitation/Implications: Future study should consider comparing the developed and developing countries. Other aspects of CSR should also be considered for better understanding. This study sheds light on the relevance of promoting the social and environmental awareness mechanisms surrounding companies in addition to developing CSR policies focused on corporations of BRICS countries.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",102,2021

The aim of this study was to explore how perceived technostress while learning a new pro-healthy technology may be grounded in dispositional anxiety, attitudes towards ICT (Information and Communication Technologies), and the way technology is presented. Verifying the hypotheses, a study was conducted with the participation of N = 1,037 individuals, in which the 'technology presentation' was manipulated and selected individual differences were measured. As expected, it was found that presenting the new technology in the form of a popular science article was associated with the perception of this technology as more threatening and overloading compared to the situation in which the technology was presented in the form of a marketing leaflet with an unequivocally positive message. Moreover, it was shown that people characterized by higher dispositional anxiety perceived the new technology as more stressful in terms of examined categories of techno-stressors. Support was also found for the hypothesis that attitudes towards ICT corelate to selected dimensions of perceived technostress in regard to newly learned technology. However, the small extents of the effect obtained in the study indicated the need to continue searching for substantial factors that would predict technostress at the early stages of learning a new technology.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",25,2021

However, detailed studies reviewing the literature related to this topic in Indonesia are lacking. Using a systematic method to review, analyze, and synthesize the literature, this study highlights how IMFIs play their role in alleviating poverty in Indonesia. Seven databases of Emerald Management, Science Direct, Google Scholar (English keywords), Google Scholar (Indonesian keywords), ProQuest, Scopus, and Academic Search Complete were used to gather articles published from early January 2016 to the end of 2020. From the data collected, it is found that the number of published articles with the theme “Islamic Microfinance Institutions and poverty alleviation” decreased beginning in 2019, with most of the research consisting of case studies in West Java using qualitative research methods. The impact felt by the community through the implementation of these programmes includes increasing societal welfare and reducing the number of poor micro and small entrepreneurs. This perceived influence has economic, social, and spiritual benefits that can help Indonesia’s economic and social growth. This review is expected to contribute to the evidence supporting poverty alleviation through Islamic microfinance in Indonesia.

However, their hydrophobicity and poor dispersibility in water restrict their applications in aqueous environments. Herein, the dispersibility of MWCNTs was significantly enhanced with a chimeric protein MPKE which consisted of a zwitterionic peptide unit and a mussel adhesive protein unit. The MPKE could be easily attached to MWCNTs (MPKE-MWCNTs) by a simple stirring process due to the versatile adhesion ability of mussel adhesive unit. As expected, the MPKE-MWCNTs displayed outstanding dispersibility in water (>7 months), as well as in alkaline solutions (pH = 12) and organic solvents (DMSO and ethanol) due to the hydrophilicity of the zwitterionic peptide unit. Moreover, the MPKE-MWCNTs were used as silver nanoparticle carriers for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol in wastewater, with the normalized rate constant knor up to 32.9 s−1 mmol−1. Meanwhile, they also exhibited excellent biocompatibility and antibacterial activity, which were favorable for wastewater treatment.

A copolymer of sulfobetaine methacrylate and aminoethyl methacrylate (pSBAE) was synthesized and deposited on ITO in the presence of pyrogallol via cyclic voltammetry. The deposition took less than 15 minutes to sufficiently inhibit cell adhesion. Using biotinylated pSBAE, the modified surface resisted nonspecific protein adsorption from the fetal bovine serum solution and detected added avidin concentrations. The results show an efficient platform to fabricate an electrochemical biosensor for the detection of biomarkers.

We have analyzed the investments in the protection and rescue system and the budget for disaster mitigation for the period between 1999 (2002) and 2019. For the period 1997–2011, we estimated investments in science. We also analyzed the structure of public funds for disaster relief and the inconsistency of criteria and approaches in Slovenian municipalities. We compared public funds with private investments in insurance, with claimed losses and with GDP. The basic finding is that there is an inverse relationship between the investments of the mentioned spatial units: the smaller the actor, the greater its relative financial role in disaster management.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",73,2021

All rights reserved.Manuscript type: Research paper Research aims: This study examines the influences of technological factors, risks and regulatory framework on the accounting treatments for cryptocurrency in Malaysia. Design/Methodology/Approach: This study employs a structured questionnaire to solicit data about the accounting treatments for cryptocurrency. Data were collected from 391 accounting and finance professionals and analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Research findings: The results of this study show that technological factors, risks and regulatory frameworks are positively associated with the accounting treatments for cryptocurrency. Theoretical contribution/Originality: This study has expanded the existing literature by focusing on the accounting treatments for cryptocurrency using the accounting conceptual framework as the theoretical argument. Practitioner/Policy implication: The findings imply that audit, tax and accounting professionals need to address the valuation and reporting of different classes and types of cryptocurrencies as their usage continue to rise. The core competencies of these professions are being disrupted by these changes; hence, these professions need to evolve and work with strategic partners/technology experts to offer cryptocurrency related advisory services. Research limitation/Implications: The researchers consider three factors namely technological, risks and regulatory frameworks that influence the accounting treatments for cryptocurrency. Future researchers may consider working with industry leaders to develop objective guidelines for cryptocurrencies, using comparative analysis of alternative accounting treatments to examine how this impacts financial results.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",60,2021

Among the main criticalities that had been identified in the previous forensic psychiatric treatment system, based on OPGs, were considered the overcrowding, the problematic hygienic-sanitary conditions, the inexistence of treatment programs that were adequate to the levels of social danger that changed over time, the non-therapeutic-rehabilitative nature of the internment in OPG, the “anti-therapeutic” presence of the Penitentiary Police personnel, the hypothetically unlimited duration of the internment.

This is also a lack of reliable instruments, especially those sufficiently specific and sensitive to longitudinally measure behavioral and functional changes. Moreover, among the very few assessment tools specifically designed to investigate treatment progress of offenders with mental disorders and the changeability of their problematic/protective behaviors, the vast majority were developed in non-Italian countries and cultures. Therefore, given the high specificity of the Italian forensic psychiatric framework, the aim of this paper was to present a new Italian instrument, the “Parma Scale” for treatment evaluation of offenders with mental disorders, which was developed as a quick and easy forensic tool specifically designed for a dynamic assessment of treatment plans (supported by hope and oriented towards a functional, personal and social recovery) and for an accurate application in different forensic psychiatric settings.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",23,2022

All rights reserved.In naming and classifying soils in Slovenia, we faced challenges from the beginning, resulting from the introduction of foreign, unfamiliar terms and changes in diagnostic criteria and analytical procedures for their verification. When translating the names of Soil Systematic Units of the Soil Map of Slovenia 1:25,000 for international publications and soil maps of Europe, misunderstandings could arise. Acric soils are defined in the Soil Map of Slovenia as very acidic soils with base saturation below 35% and belong to the Illuvial soils. The WRB classification criterion for acric properties is the low cation exchange capacity of the clay fraction of the soil (< 24 cmolc kg-1 clay) with a simultaneous effective base saturation below 50%. Soils with an argic horizon and acric properties are referred to as reference group Acrisols. Illuvial acric soils have been translated as Acrisols, which is incorrect according to WRB classification criteria and is misleading, especially for foreign readers unfamiliar with soils in Slovenia and Slovenian classification cri-teria. In this paper, we examine the history of the use of the term acric in Slovenian pedological literature and soil classification, as well as the diagnostic properties and criteria associated with this term. We found out that the term acric was introduced in 1973 based on the legend of the FAO soil map of 1968. Different criteria (horizons, properties, analytical methods) were used in the different periods, which were not updat-ed with the development of the international WRB classification.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",48,2022

However, TB is not evenly distributed in the country, presumably due to state-specific risk factors. Objectives: This study maps TB and socioeconomic risk factors in Nigeria. Methods: State-level age/sex standardized tuberculosis notification data was utilized in an ecological design to evaluate the spatial distribu-tion of TB in Nigeria and its social and economic consequences between 2012 and 2015. Negative binomial regression analysis examined the relationship between TB and five state-level covariates: HIV, BCG coverage, GDP per capita, percentage underweight, and percentage treatment success rate. Global and Local Moran’s I test statistics in R were used for spatial analysis. Results: The mean age/sex TB CNR was 54.4/100,000. Non-spatial ecological regression analysis found that TB was greater in states with high HIV, low BCG, low GDP per capita, and low TB death rates. Three states—Nasarawa, Benue, and Taraba—had high TB rates and spatially auto-correlated TB CNRs. Conclusions: TB case notification differed by age and gender. Economically-disadvantaged states exhibited higher TB case notifi-cation, HIV prevalence, lower BCG coverage, and lower mortality rates. The study found three TB hotspots. To reduce the national TB notification rate discrepancy, TB policies should incorporate social variables and target high-risk states with specific initiatives.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",33,2022

A hybrid flow shop scheduling model with workpiece transfer time, specific equipment constraints and fuzzy time was established first, and a matrix coding method based on workpieces and equipment was adopted, then a new Slope algorithm was proposed to generate the initial population. The crossover operator was improved based on the linear sorting and tabu search strategy, and the adaptive mutation rate and two mutation operators were used to improve the global optimization ability. Further, the harmony Search algorithm was used to enhance the local search ability.

The pressure of legal repression, however weak it may have been at times, caused anti-Semites to retreat to language formulas that were no longer (or not yet) legally objectionable, without therefore giving up their convictions. This borderline is fundamentally semantically indeterminable, because associations, puns and cynicism cannot be banned. The legal instruments often come to nothing, because a judiciary under the rule of law may only sanction deeds, not thoughts. Each judgement inevitably redefines this borderline, at least in nuances. By contributing in this way to constituting the discursive framework of anti-Semitism, even if there is a broad social consensus of its ostracism, the law is both a partial solution and part of the problem.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",14,2022

Subsequently, by analyzing two case studies - an essay by AfD politician Alexander Gauland and a speech by Donald Trump - it is shown that right-wing populist discourses asserting a struggle between the people and the »globalist elite« reproduce anti-Semitic patterns even though »Jews« are not explicitly mentioned. Finally, it is argued that this phenomenon can be grasped with the concept of structural anti-Semitism. With this term, it can be made clear that right-wing populism indeed has an anti-Semitic potential and that the contents and functions of anti-Semitism and racism must be distinguished.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",21,2022

Therefore, small inefficiencies in the placement solution can be boosted during routing, which has a negative impact on design quality and convergence. Unfortunately, most academic research works evaluate their results only at the target step without considering the complete place and route flow. In this work, we experimentally explored different flows built up from academic placers and routers to find which one leads to the best overall results so that researchers can use them as reference. In order to evaluate those flows, we used the ISPD 2018 and ISPD 2019 Contest benchmarks, which are the most realistic academic benchmarks available with placement and routing information.

All rights reserved.The article focuses on The Stele to the Merits and Virtues of The Emperor of the Great Qing (大清皇帝功德碑) that was erected in the Joseon state in 1639 after the 1637 peace agreement and recognition of Qing suzerainty. The stele is examined as a visible embodiment of the imperial policy in order to specify its features and evaluate the representing component. The main source is the translation of the Manchu text on the Stele first made by A.M. Pozdneev and published in 1891. The Chinese version of the inscription is also used. As a result, the features of the Qing policy towards Joseon visualized in the monument, perceived and presented within the sinocentric context are identified and analyzed. The acceptance of vassalage is presented as a historically determined event: the military attack took place because Joseon had violated the previously concluded alliance with the Manchus. The relations established after 1637 did not imply annexation and influence on the government system. In fact, the vassalage was a nominal act: the ruler returned to his country, and the people came back to peaceful life. The recognition of suzerainty resulted in both actual (social) and sacred legitimation of the van’s power: he admitted his guilt and subsequently became a conductor of Heaven’s will within his state. The Stele can be regarded as an official document created in the “solid book” form (稳书), typical for China. This monument can be seen as an official document that embodied Korea’s recognition of its vassalage to the Qing dynasty and recorded Joseon’s recognition of the Manchu ruler as an emperor of the Celestial Empire.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",27,2022

A good knowledge of the breeding sites and of the resistance profile of the vectors could facilitate the development of an appropriate control strategy. This study looks at the larval ecology and the susceptibility profile of An. gambiae s.l. to insecticides in urban and rural areas in Kribi, South Region of Cameroon. Methods: Mosquito breeding sites were categorized and geo-referenced. For each site, larvae were collected and reared and physicochemical parameters were measured in situ. The susceptibility of anopheles to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), deltamethrin and permethrin, after pre-exposure to piperonyl butoxide (PBO) or not, was evaluated on the reared larvae. The Kdr mutation was detected using the Hot Oligonucleotide Ligation Assay (HOLA). Results: Natural breeding sites of An. gambiae s.l. were tyre tracks (12%, n=10), unbuilt wells (5%, n=4), pools of residual water (57%, n=48), foot and hoof prints, gullies, streams and the banks of the Kienké River (15%, n=13). Artificial breeding sites were abandoned dugouts (11%, n=9). Breeding sites in urban areas were characterized by higher mean values of temperature, conductivity, salinity and turbidity compared to the breeding sites in the rural area. The breeding sites of An. gambiae s.l. in urban Kribi were found to be sunnier than those in rural Kribi. A total of 4320 adults were used for testing, 1 440 mosquitoes from rural Kribi, 1 440 from urban Kribi and 1 440 specimens from the laboratory Kisumu strain. For DDT and deltamethrin, susceptibility tests showed that mortality was lower in a situation of no pre-exposure to PBO than in a situation of pre-exposure to PBO in the two study areas. The frequency of the resistant allele (R) was high for the Kdr West mutation in both urban (0.94) and rural areas in Kribi (0.93). Conclusion: An. gambiae s.l. colonizes a wide range of breeding sites and develops metabolic and mutation resistance to recommended insecticides. The search of alternative molecules for vector control is a necessity.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",null,2022

While 61 health districts (HDs) have stopped mass drug administration (MDA), transmission persists in 9 HDs despite good reported MDA coverage. To validate the reported coverage, an independent post-MDA survey was conducted in Tenkodogo and Fada N'Gourma HDs in September 2018. Materials & methods: The study population consisted of all persons in the visited communities. The Coverage survey sample builder (CSSB) tool was used to calculate the sample size and to conduct the random selection of households. A total of 30 villages per HD were selected. The investigators were Ministry of Education agents and health workers not involved in MDA. Data were collected on smartphones through the KoBoCollect application regarding age, sex, drug ingestion (ivermectin + albendazole), adverse events, and whether respondents understood MDA guidelines. Stata Version 14 software was used for data analysis. Results: A total of 3,741 individuals were surveyed, 53.3% were female and the median age was 14 years. Surveyed epidemiological coverage was 74% [95% CI: 72-76.1] in Fada N'Gourma and 79.1% [95% CI: 77.2-80.9] in Tenkodogo, compared to reported coverages of 82.6% and 83% respectively. Village-level coverage ranged from 32.9% to 100% in Fada N'Gourma and from 56.7% to 93.3% in Tenkodogo. In total, 99% of those treated said they had swallowed the drugs in front of the community drug distributor (CDD) and confirmed the use of dose poles. The main reasons for non-treatment were non-visitation of the compound by CDD (54%) and absences during MDA (43%). Results showed that surveyed coverage was lower than reported coverage in both HDs, yet both were above the 65% threshold recommended by WHO. However, major variations of coverage have been noted among villages. Directly observed treatment appeared to have been well respected. Discussion & conclusion: The main challenges to increase coverage will be the systematic revisiting of households with absentees and the targeting of all households in each village.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",null,2022

All rights reserved.The purpose of the research paper is to analyze the influence of the social and political conditions on changes in confessional life in the occupied Ukrainian lands during World War II. The scientific novelty: it is claimed that it was social and political conditions that caused drastic changes in the confessional map of Ukraine in 1939-1945. The determinant factor of the occupation policy – the destruction of the established confessional configuration that traditionally existed on Ukrainian lands in the USSR, Poland and Romania – has been proven. Autocephalous tendencies in Orthodox life in the General Governorate, Reichskommissariat ‘Ukraine’ and ‘Transnistria’ were studied. The personal visions of the leading Orthodox bishops regarding the institutional status of the Orthodox Church in Ukraine are reflected. The specific approaches of the German and Romanian administrations to the organization of church life are highlighted. Conclusions: it is proved that despite the attempt to create a single Orthodox Church in the territory occupied by the Wehrmacht, this did not happen due to the position of the German leadership and different views of the hierarchs of the Orthodox churches. It has been proven that all institutional changes of the occupiers grossly violated the existing traditions and canonical norms, which deprived the Church of its autonomy. It was determined that multiconfessionalism and the lack of autocephalous status of Ukrainian Orthodoxy complicated the process of forming a single Orthodox Church of Ukraine. The influence of the Moscow Patriarchate, as well as the opposition of Berlin, made this process impossible during the war. It is noted that the Romanian administration in the occupied south-western lands of Ukraine (‘Transnistria’), with the support of the Romanian Orthodox Mission, contributed to the revival of Christianity, relied on the pre-revolutionary church organization, clerics and monarchism. The Ukrainian-phobic attitudes of the majority of Romanian bishops and the occupation authorities which led to the fight against the sprouts of Ukrainian autocephaly are shown. It has been proven that the rebuilt churches, the restoration of services in them, the involvement of hundreds of clerics, Christian charity and charity, raising children in the spirit of piety, etc., contributed to the revival of ancient Christian traditions and, at the same time, were a tool for the affirmation of the occupation regime.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",60,2022

The author emphasizes that the transfer of separate ownership of premises does not mean that this right arises ex lege in the course of liquidation, bankruptcy proceedings or enforcement proceedings in a housing cooperative. He states that only the transfer of separate ownership of premises is involved when separate ownership of premises has already been previously established.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",26,2022

All rights reserved.Interpretive and narrative research approaches, the experiences of academic administrators other than deans, chairs, and presi-dents, and academic identity work beyond graduate students and beginning professors are all areas that are underrepresented in the literature on higher educational administration. This article builds on recent narrative research by applying higher educational administrative theories as interpretive lenses to propose a model for helping to understand the development and application of associate deans’ academic identities. Among the findings were that academic identities helped explain associate deans’ approaches to their roles, their views of their surrounding organizations, and their reasons for assuming the role. Further, the associate deans who participated in this research did not experience their transition to the role as an identity crisis in the ways typically described and assumed by higher educational leadership scholars. Instead, they drew upon their well-established academic identities and, in keeping with the nascent research on academic identity work, were intentional in their efforts to maintain their academic identities.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",55,2022

According to recent data from hospital in Central African Republic studies, the Paoua health district reports between 300 and 400 cases of ophidian envenomation each year. However, no epidemiological study on snakebites has been conducted at national level, nor a control strategy developed. The objective of this study is to describe the epidemiological aspects of snakebites in two rural communities, one located in savannah zone and the other in forest zone (both secondary and primary forest) in order to ensure adequate management of snakebites in these regions. Method: Prospective community-based study in two health districts in the Central African Republic, the health district of Paoua in savannah area and the health district of Mbaïki in forest area, from December 2019 to January 2021. Snakebites were investigated in the community by selected trained people in charge of reporting data regarding all known cases of snakebites occurring during the study period. The data were actively notified either by health personal or community health workers in order to determine the circumstances and severity of the bite, its management and the clinical course in case of envenomation. Results: A total of 412 snakebite cases were recorded during the study period, of which 198 cases occurred in the rural community of the forest zone and 214 in the community of the savannah zone. Case fatality rate was 5% in the forest zone and 1% in the savanna zone. The incidence rate of snakebite was significantly higher in savannah children compared to those in the forest (98/100,000 vs. 25.1/100,000; p<0.00001) while this incidence rate was significantly lower from age 45 onwards in the savannah area compared to the forest area (167/100,000 vs. 200/100,000; p=0.02). The case fatality rate of children and adults up to 44 years of age appeared to be significantly higher in the forest zone (7 deaths vs 1 death). Snakebites occurred significantly more frequently during field activities in the savannah zone than in the forest zone (51% vs 26%; p<0.0001). The symptomatology of bites was dominated by edema of the bitten limb and bleeding in the two study areas, compatible with cytotoxic and hemorrhagic syndromes due to viper bites. Conclusion: With an incidence rate of more than 160 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the active population aged 15-44 years in rural communities of the forest and savannah zone, snakebites remain a public health problem in Central African Republic. A study on the toxicity of snakebites in Central African Republic is recommended. Besides, it is urgent to make anti-venomous serums available in health facilities in order to reduce the mortality related to the envenomation.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",null,2022

The audio recordings additionally differed in terms of job prestige (high vs. low) and performance level (high vs. low). Compared to English speakers, Tagalog speakers were rated as less competent and comprehensible overall, and listeners wished to be treated more like the clients in scenarios recorded by English than Tagalog speakers, with all effects magnified for speakers with heavier foreign accents. Nonetheless, listeners generally evaluated English and Tagalog speakers similarly in low-prestige and in low-performance scenarios, but rated low performance less negatively in low-prestige positions.

Personal proper names (i.e. anthroponyms) have a unique ontological and epistemological status in the anthropocentric cognitive system. 3. An anthroponym is a message determined by cognitive needs and the system of values of a given linguistic and cultural community. In order to reconstruct narrations embedded in surnames it is proposed that the following steps be adopted: 1) perform statistical analysis concerned with the number of onymic derivation sets, 2) undertake semantic studies considering the level of categorization of appellatives which motivate the creation of surnames, 3) adopt endocentric and exocentric perspectives in the analysis of descriptive functions of anthroponyms which belong to particular motivation-formal types.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",21,2022

The set of taxonomic operators in the field of chrematonymy includes the term markonym ‘brand name’ identified with marketing chrematonym and confronted with other terminological concepts such as firmonym, logonym or ergonym and pragmatonym, and, finally, descriptively included trade name or trademark.

Publisher: Institute of Polish Language, Polish Academy of Sciences.This article examines the station names of 142 Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stations across Singapore’s five fully operational MRT lines using primary sources (digitised newspapers, maps, and press releases) and secondary sources (scholarly research on Singapore place names and information from government agencies). There are two research objectives: firstly, to determine the common naming strategies of Singapore’s MRT station names, and secondly, to analyse features of Singapore’s socio-political and linguistic identity by studying these names. Common naming patterns of Singapore’s station names include associative names, where the station is named after nearby physical or man-made features; descriptive names, where the name describes a particular aspect of the area; and eponymous names, where the station is named after a famous person or entity. We argue that station names reflect the state’s language and socio-political policies and shed deeper light on some of the complex and contradictory forces at play in the nation’s linguistic and socio-political identity. Singapore’s language shift towards English is evident as English is frequently used to name stations, particularly among newer MRT lines, where the public can suggest and vote on station names. At the same time, there are toponyms in local languages like Malay that serve as indexes of localness of the area around the station, showing the cultural dimension that station names have as metaphors for the area’s history and heritage. Yet, Singapore’s pragmatic socio-political identity ultimately means that the practical, referential function of names takes precedence over the cultural functions of naming.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",77,2022

One can make use of contemporary travel reports as an example of nowadays very popular branch of literature relating to other cultures, thereby confirming the consequential status of multiculturalism as a socio-cultural aspect. As the methodological basis of the work, modern literary and cultural onomastics, and onomastics of discourse have been selected. Discourse is understood as a communication phenomenon of a higher level, concentrating various components and not only verbal ones. Furthermore, it is motivated by social, ideological, and cultural factors which are manifested in different forms. The crucial methodological context is the adoption of discourse linguistics as an extensive research program that can help to create the additional context of the proper names observed in travel literature. The aim of the work is to highlight the main discourse strategies concerning the multiculturalism aspects of proper names present in modern travel literature. Three primary strategies were identified i.e. assimilation, exoticisation and neutralisation. Depending on the strategy adopted, the proper name relates to the ideological level of discourse to a varying degree, it also profiles the Known–Other/Strange relation, approximates given cultures or reflects their disparateness. As one can see, the research has identified many different points of liaison between proper names and the ideology of the text and, what is more, the creation of the world in a chosen discourse. Moreover, it confirms the thesis that proper names, analyzed on the discourse level, requires a context approach revealing its whole semantic and functional potential in microtext as well as macrotext.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2022

The object of study were publications issued between 1918 and 1923, when the borders of the Second Polish Republic were being formed and the Polish-Ukrainian dispute over the nationality of the eastern part of Galicia was taking place. The analysis of the material is both quantitative and qualitative. The quantitative analysis deals with the changing frequency of each of the two names in “Gazeta Lwowska”, taking into account names with a wschodnia/zachodnia (Eng. eastern/western) component and derivative words, i.e., the adjectives małopolski/galicyjski and the personal names Galicjanin/Małopolanin. The qualitative analysis shows the nomenclature in context, the range of both names, as well as the discursive strategy adopted by the authors of individual articles in which both choronyms frequently appear. The combination of these two methods makes it possible to show the ideological function played by the name Małopolska during the struggle for the borders of the Polish state, and to describe the changing meaning of the name Galicja at that time. The findings of the paper also support the findings of other researchers (Batowski, 1993; Hibel, 2014), namely that Eastern Galicia existed primarily in Polish as an element of international discourse, while in Polish domestic politics it was replaced by the name Wschodnia Małopolska.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",15,2022

By calculation, he verifies them in the so-called “geometric plan” in the project documentation. The functional geometric parameters should be determined primarily for critical elements, i.e. for structures whose geometric accuracy is important for the execution of subsequent works, such as technologies requiring high precision and specific structures. The assumption is that designers will incorporate variations in geometric accuracy primarily in the development of the spatial parameters of the structures, which should ensure that the dimensional requirements for the completed structures will be met. One of these parameters is headroom. The design of headroom must respect the minimum height requirements prescribed by legislation, and where appropriate, by technical standards. At the same time, the design must respect the technological possibilities of the construction of individual structures – geometric deviations. To comply with the dimensional requirements for the completed structures, the geometric accuracy deviations should be determined in accordance with the requirements of the technical standards for the execution of the individual parts of the building structures and/or for their design. The aim of this article is to establish a calculation procedure for determining the safe design clearance so that the requirements of the legislation are met after implementation. The increase is determined based on a calculation procedure of the limiting geometric deviations that may affect the resulting headroom.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",8,2022

There is presently significant research in Consumer Neuroscience based on consumer behaviour and understanding of these processes. In this study, we have used Electroencephalography (EEG) and Event-Related Potentials (ERP) to capture consumer responses to highly familiar product images. EEG analysed from the 27 participants was used to extract P1, N1, P300, N400 and Late Posterior components. The analysis showed that the early ERP components viz., P1, N1 and P300 can differentiate between consumer liking and disliking of products. In contrast, the late ERP components N400 and Late Posterior components could not differentiate in the highly familiar product category. The results indicate that after continuous exposure, consumer preference towards highly-familiar products occurs as a part of automatic, unconscious mental processes irrespective of the product properties. Further research in this direction can test for the transference of consumer preference: from a conscious mental process to a subconscious mental process due to excessive and continuous product exposure and marketing repetition. Our study demonstrates that consumer behaviour in response to highly-familiar products can be classified using early ERP components only.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",27,2022

Such elements form a part of many existing bridges which, although not complying with current code specifications, have not as yet displayed any significant signs of distress in spite of the increase in traffic volume and loads over the years. The work is based on a comparative study of the predicted and experimentally established values of load-carrying capacity and location and causes of failure of half-jointed beams with reinforcement layouts that replicate those found in structures designed in accordance with previous code specifications. The results obtained show significant shortcomings of the assessment method as this is found not only to underestimate load-carrying capacity by a margin ranging between 40 % and 65 %, but also to often fail to identify the location and causes of failure. Therefore, there is a need for an alternative assessment method that will be based on concepts capable of both providing a realistic description of structural-concrete behaviour and identifying the causes of failure leading to the loss of load-carrying capacity.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",10,2022

This study deals with the design and simulation of a bearing housing made from titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) using the selective laser melting (SLM) technique. The Finite Element Analysis (FEA) method was used for assessing the suitability of Ti6Al4V for aerospace application. The choice of Ti6Al4V is due to the comparative advantage of its strength-to-weight ratio. The implicit and explicit modules of the Abaqus software were employed for the non-linear and linear analyses of the component part. The results obtained revealed that the titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) sufficiently meets the design, functional and service requirements of the bearing housing component produced for aerospace application. The designed bearing is suitable for a high speed and temperature application beyond 1900 K, while the maximum stress induced in the component during loading was 521 kPa. It is evident that the developed stresses do not result in a distortion or deformation of the material with yield strength in the region of 820 MPa. This work provides design data for the development of a bearing housing for AM under the technique of SLM using Ti6Al4V by reflecting the knowledge of the material behaviour under the operating conditions.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",41,2022

One of the relevant aspects of recent works is the influence of the chevron inclination angle between the heat exchanger plates. This work aims to analyse the impact of the chevron inclination angle by applying an effective concept in a sunflower vegetable oil cooler. Comparisons are made with theoretical and experimental results from the literature for works that consider angles of inclination equal to 30°, 45°, and 60°. An analysis model that does not consider the inclination angle as an explicit parameter is included for comparison purposes. In addition to the angle of inclination, two other parameters, the mass flow rate of the cold fluid (water) and the number of plates, are considered crucial for determining and analysing the results. Nusselt number, global heat transfer coefficient, effectiveness, heat transfer rate, and outlet temperatures for hot and cold fluids are presented in a graphical format. The results point to the need to improve models applied to gasket plate heat exchangers concerning the influence of the inclination angle since there are significant differences between those obtained and analysed in this work.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",13,2022

Licensed under a CC-BY 4.0 licence.Building structures with integrated energy-active elements (BSIEAE) present a progressive alternative for building construction with multifunctional energy functions. The aim was to determine the energy potential of a building envelope with integrated energy-active elements in the function of direct-heating, semi-accumulation and accumulation of large-area radiant heating. The research methodology consists in an analysis of building structures with energy-active elements, creation of mathematical-physical models based on the simplified definition of heat and mass transfer in radiant large-area heating, and a parametric study of the energy potential of individual variants of technical solutions. The results indicate that the increase in heat loss due to the location of the tubes in the structure closer to the exterior is negligible for Variant II, semi-accumulation heating, and Variant III, accumulation heating, as compared to Variant I, direct heating, it is below 1 % of the total delivered heat flux. The direct heat flux to the heated room is 89.17 %, 73.36 %, and 58.46 % of the total heat flux for Variant I, Variant II and Variant III, respectively. For Variant II and Variant III, the heat storage accounts for 14.84 %, and 29.86 % of the total heat flux, respectively. Variants II and III appear to be promising in terms of heat/cool accumulation with an assumption of lower energy demand (at least 10 %) than for low inertia walls. We plan to extend these simplified parametric studies with dynamic computer simulations to optimise the design and composition of the panels with integrated energy-active elements.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",37,2022

The expressions for squeeze film pressure, load-carrying capacity, and squeeze film time are obtained analytically, the results are discussed for various values of operating parameters, and are plotted graphically. It is found that the squeeze film characteristics of porous curved annular plates are improved using a non-Newtonian fluid in the presence of an external magnetic field. The effect of roughness parameter is to increase (decrease) the squeeze film attributes for azimuthal (radial) roughness configuration as compared to the smooth case.

Summarized conditions describing beaver-dammed and undammed stream reaches suggested that 13 of the 18 evaluated metrics differed. After accounting for beavers' selection of lower-gradient stream reaches with less forested cover, the number of stream and riparian metrics that differed significantly dropped to 5. Beaver dams increased pool area and depth, despite failing to increase the frequency of wood >10 cm in diameter. This suggests that beavers build dams utilizing pieces of wood smaller than most monitoring programs count. Changes in stream and riparian conditions due to beavers were insufficient to alter macroinvertebrate metrics commonly used to assess water quality. The presence of beaver dams in a reach was associated with less vegetative and woody cover along the stream's edge. The reduction of shrub cover and the presence of upstream beaver dams likely played a role in the small increases observed in water temperatures. The fact that beavers tended to build dams in reaches with elevated water tables may have minimized water temperature increases. Based on the beaver occupancy rate found in this study, changes in stream and riparian conditions due to new beaver dams should be expected in 5% to 15% of the stream reaches similar to those in this study over the next 2 decades. An increasing number of beavers occupying stream reaches represents an important passive restoration approach that will improve the quality of aquatic systems on public lands.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",107,2022

However, there are some instances where the 2 species have co-occurred for decades, and healthy and diverse stream habitat conditions have been suggested to facilitate sympatry. Our goal was to evaluate how habitat diversity may interplay in the negative interactions between Brook Trout and Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout O. c. bouvieri in the Goose Creek subbasin in the western United States. We determined that neither species was abundant when they occurred in sympatry. Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout were present at 8 of the 41 sites sampled, and they were sympatric with Brook Trout at 4 sites. Quantile regression revealed that Brook Trout represented a limiting factor for age-1 and older Cutthroat Trout density (fish/100m2). Lower variation in water depth reflecting poor physical habitat conditions also appeared to be a limiting factor. Age-0 Cutthroat Trout were also in poorer body condition in the presence of Brook Trout. Multiple linear regression showed Brook Trout of all sizes to have a negative effect, and diversity of cover elements a positive but lesser effect, on age-0 Cutthroat Trout body condition. Brook Trout appear to negatively influence the early life stages of Yellowstone Cutthroat Trout in the Goose Creek subbasin, similar to the negative impacts observed elsewhere. However, our data also suggested that habitat complexity may partially offset this negative interaction at some level by affording more niche space for partitioning and adding habitat capacity. If further research showed this pattern to exist more broadly, then protection and restoration of habitat complexity and diversity may play an important role in mediating the negative impacts of Brook Trout on Cutthroat Trout and potentially facilitating sympatry where Brook Trout eradication is not feasible.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",75,2022

All rights reserved.Native resident salmonids throughout North America have experienced population declines, and understanding factors that influence their contemporary distribution and abundance may help conserve and manage such species. We examined the influence of several environmental factors on the current distribution and abundance of westslope cutthroat trout Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi in central Idaho, based on snorkel survey data collected from 2010 to 2019. In total, 2758 snorkel surveys were conducted at 1000 sites; cutthroat trout were present during 1277 of the surveys, and their occupancy rate was higher if brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis were absent (0.48) than if brook trout were present (0.31). During surveys where cutthroat trout were present, mean density was 1.81 fish/100 m2. Underlying lithology was associated with westslope cutthroat trout distribution but not their abundance, suggesting that lithology may influence broader habitat features that affect their ability to fulfill a component of their life history, such as spawning or overwinter survival, more so than characteristics that affect their abundance, such as microhabitat suitability. Not surprisingly, westslope cutthroat trout occupancy was negatively influenced by the abundance of nonnative brook trout, but in central Idaho this effect is tempered by the limited distribution of brook trout. Both the occupancy and the abundance of westslope cutthroat trout were related in a nonlinear, dome-shaped manner to site elevation; considering that elevation was included as a surrogate for stream water temperature (which is also commonly related to trout occupancy and abundance in a dome-shaped manner), intermediate stream elevations (in central Idaho, 800 to 1600 m) currently seem to provide an ideal thermal regime for westslope cutthroat trout.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",83,2022

All rights reserved.The southwestern pond turtle (Actinemys pallida) is a semiaquatic turtle that occasionally spends time on land to bask, oviposit, make intermittent overland movements, and overwinter in terrestrial locations. Use of both aquatic and terrestrial environments exposes semiaquatic turtles to increased risk of injury or mortality from floods, predation attempts, and other environmental hazards (e.g., human activities such as vehicle strikes, etc.). We collected injury and morphological abnormality data from adult turtles at 3 study sites along the length of the Mojave River in San Bernardino County, California: 1 site on the upper half of the Mojave River (hereafter known as UHMRS) and 2 sites each on the lower half of the Mojave River (hereafter known as LHMRS). The studies were conducted when turtles were most active between May and October 1998-1999 and again from April to September 2016-2019. A total of 84 A. pallida were captured among all sites and all years. Seventeen percent (n = 8) of the turtles captured at UHMRS exhibited shell abnormalities (natural variations in shell or bone morphology). Injuries (damage inflicted by force to the shell or body) occurred in 68% (n = 26) of captured turtles at both the LHMRS sites combined and 78% (n = 36) of turtles captured at the UHMRS alone. A total of 74% (n = 62) of turtles had injuries at all sites combined. There was no statistical difference in the proportion of injured and noninjured turtles between the sexes for either the 2 LHMRS sites combined or the UHMRS. Mean carapace length was not significantly different between injured and noninjured turtles for these same sites. Injuries occurred in the majority of captured turtles at all sites and may be an indicator of the extent of threats facing these turtles.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",95,2022

In other words, the paper analyses the transferred meaning(s) that the analysed verbs express in both languages in order to identify the other processes expressed by the verbs of drinking. The corpus for the analysis was excerpted from the relevant monolingual dictionaries of English and Serbian and consists of ten verbs of drinking: five English verbs, to drink, to guzzle, to imbibe, to quench, to suck and five Serbian verbs, piti, ispiti, lokati, napiti se, opiti se. The dictionary definitions of the ten verbs were analysed in order to identify the transferred meanings of the verbs. The definitions were then subjected to conceptual analysis with the goal of identifying the conceptual mechanisms (conceptual metaphor or conceptual metonymy) that underly the transferred meanings. The identified meanings were also subjected to contrastive analysis that aimed at identifying the similarities and differences in transferred meanings among the analysed verbs and at identifying their formal correspondents or translation equivalents. The analysis shows that in both languages drinking verbs develop their transferred meanings primarily regarding the concepts of accepting or absorbing an entity and that in most cases such meanings and conceptual mechanisms underlying them show a high degree of equivalence, as the most frequent conceptual mechanism in both languages is conceptual metaphor. However, the differences are mostly observed at the semantic level.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",18,2022

The study of the pottery’s shape features makes it possible to identify the morphological evolution of Meroitic ceramics, its functions, and local characteristics. Archaeometric analysis of pottery helps to differentiate the methods of its manufacture and production centers where it was made. As a result, we can say that each settlement had its own pottery workshops, which provided, first of all, for the needs of local residents. The ceramic trade was poorly developed, and ordinary types of utensils were used in exchange for their contents. The location of the pottery workshops identified in Hamadab and Muweis demonstrates the development of a planning system for their settlements according to a single model, clearly divided into residential and craft areas, being a characteristic feature of the production infrastructure of the capital region of the Meroitic Kingdom. Although the image of Meroitic material culture shows a high degree of centralization, clearly expressed in the unification of the temple and administrative architecture, and the style of household and cult items (primarily ceramics), we can conclude that the handicraft production and exchange of goods between Meroitic settlements were less centralized, which led to the creation and active functioning of their own pottery workshops both in large urban centers and small administrative and temple complexes.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",59,2022

His latest novel, Silence, challenges the conventions which are understood to represent the basis of our understanding of reality – the data, its collection and recording and how it is used to configure the dimension of time. The novel opens as a routine mix of chatter, or noise, and silence as its negative counterpart representing the time passing. However, as the novel unfolds, this seemingly objective view from the outside, delves into personal experiences of the protagonists creating certain soundscapes alternating between the noise and silence, depending more and more on sensory perception rather than on rational processing. With its skeletal structure and utmost reduction of narrative elements, the novel Silence approaches the idea of silence in a similar manner to composer John Cage in his work 4.33 (1952), who researched the idea in the medium of music, an art which like literature relies on rigorous formal features. Silence, for Don DeLillo as well as for Cage is not equal to the lack of content; in contrast, it represents the alternative aspect of sound and/or noise.

All rights reserved.This paper carries out a morphological and syntactic analysis of errors in the form of a dependent member of a nominal phrase, specifically – in gender of the congruent word. The corpus has been formed through the excerption of material from 503 assignments written by students who have taken an intensive course in Serbian as a foreign language (at level A1 and A2) at the Centre for Serbian as a Foreign Language at the Faculty of Philosophy in Novi Sad. The aims of the analysis are as follows: identification of er-rors, systematisation according to types, quantitative and statistical analysis, presentation of analysis results according to types of errors, frequency of occurrence and the students’ first language (since the participants are eth-nically and linguistically heterogeneous). Another aim is to compare, as far as possible, the analysis outcome with results of previous analyses of errors in gender of the congruent word in language production by students with Hungarian as their first language learning Serbian as their non-native lan-guage. Since there is no category of gender in Hungarian, it is pointed out that the acquiring of this category is especially difficult for speakers of this language. The analysis has shown that: foreign students incorrectly use male gender forms most frequently (45,5%), while the incorrect use of female and neutral gender is completely equal (27,2% per gender). Considerable similarities in errors have been established between foreign students and students with Hungarian as their first language.

The introductory considerations relate to the issue of translation and equivalence in general, as well as to the double dimension of the equivalence of a legal text and the notion of functional equivalent. The challenges of legal translation are examined through the combination of six elements: the question of the legal norm and its consequences on transla-tion, the non-concordance of legal concepts between different languages, the specificity and diversity of languages and cultures within which the law is elaborated, the question of equivalence of legal effects, the possibility of translating the law and the variety of fields, a new aspect specific in partic-ular to EU law. Finally, the question of the education of legal translators is considered in the context of the choice between translation and legal skills, or preferably, the fusion of the two.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",37,2022

We critically read de Rougemont's thought that love-passion, as the basic guiding thread of the myth of Tristan and Isolde, still sovereignly rules the unconscious being of modern man, giving him a one-sided vision of the play about love. Following his argumentation, we examine the connections between courtly and chivalrous love, Cathar heresy and troubadour love poetry. Denis de Rougemont contrasts eros, which ignites passion that descends into the darkness of death, with agape, i.e. the Christian love for one's neighbour. We question whether de Rougemont's solution to the problem of love by establishing merciful love as a necessary moral choice can be a satisfactory answer for modern man.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",21,2022

The aim of the analysis is to identify conceptual metaphors that have driven the derivation of these senses and compare English and Serbian in terms of conceptualisations of abstract notions using temperature as the source domain. Furthermore, the analysis aims at revealing whether the conceptualisation of an abstract notion using a certain degree of warmth as the source domain activates the conceptualisation of the opposite abstract notion starting from a degree of coldness and vice versa, i.e. to investigate whether there are pairs of opposite metaphors activated in semantic dispersion of the given adjectives. The analysis has shown that there is a significant similarity between English and Serbian regarding the conceptualisation of abstract notions using temperature as the source domain. Still, English displays a greater variety of abstract notions conceptualised in the given way. There are rare cases in which derivations of metaphoric senses of adjectives belonging to the opposite sections of the temperature scale are mutually related in the sense that they are driven by opposite metaphoric patterns.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",40,2022

All rights reserved.In order to fully question the issue of ekphrasis in John Keats’s ”Ode on a Grecian Urn”, this paper begins by giving a brief historical and theoretical framework of ekphrasis, and then analyses a concrete ekphrasis in Keats’s poem. Historically speaking, the meaning of ekphrasis made a large shift in modern times compared to the original. Ancient Progymnasmata do not narrow the term based on subject matter, but rather define it using the category of vividness, enárgeia, and only later through the examinations of ancient ekphrasis of works of spatial arts, in literary texts as well as in rhetorical ones, ekphrasis becomes narrowed to a literary evocation of works of spatial arts. This happens in Spitzer’s analysis of the poem in the second half of the twentieth century, thus proving “Ode on the Grecian Urn” to be a crucial text in rethinking the term. This paper tends to reconcile the original and modern theories of ekphrasis through the poem itself. In a theoretical context, ekphrasis’s share in narration and description, and its discursive features are shown, opening the debate on the common linkage of ekphrasis to description, and alienation from narration. Choosing to address ekphrasis from the perspective of the ekphrastic poetry itself rather than a theoretical point of view, the paper shows how the urn cannot solely be seen as “silent” since it strives to tell a legend, a narrative, which is contained in the urn as an aesthetic object and work of sculptural art. This text does not tend to discover the real models for the ekphrasis, but it does offer some sculptural works and paintings which could have inspired Keats. The text is more inclined toward unveiling the discursive context which could have influenced the poet: the (meta)aesthetics of ancient Greece, derived both from poetry and philosophy. The most important objective of the paper is to offer a new reading of the poem through a critical dialogue with the most accepted readings of the “Ode”, primarily those of Spitzer and Brooks, and through questioning of common places in literary criticism of the poem.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",24,2022

All rights reserved.The multifaceted interrelationships of the various media are now considered to be a particular productive area of comparative strategy. The generalised typology among the types of intermedia at the present stage is considered to be the most fruitful and effective, in particular, ekphrasis and intermedia – a particular manifestation of intermedia, the phenomenon of specific expressive mediation of one media in the figurative field of another. Intermediate format, developed by the interaction of different sign systems and the content encoded by them, mainly – literature and other arts with emphasis on the sign and semantic correspondence of comparisons, has significant artistic effectiveness. A way to realise the ekphrasis of the reception as a description of the case is any kind of art in the literary text. At the same time, the pre-ferred determinant of ekphrasis as a description of a work of art in a literary text is suggested to be its relation to a specific work of authorship, although it also assumes the spread of the ekphrasis to similar or non-existent but genre conventional art variants with a pre-eminent inheritance of the corre-sponding art. In determining the universal common principles of organising such sovereignty of sign systems, positioned in the status of local variants of different discursive practices in the process of their syncretic interaction in the literary dimension, effective for illuminating the raised issue are primarily the tendencies of the extracurricular direction of literary criticism, initiated by Lotman's semiotic concept, initiated by the first concept, the imposition and intersection of semantic spaces capable of generating new meaning. The empirical plan of ekphrasis is vividly and convincingly actualised in the novels of famous Serbian writers A. Gatalica, M. Pavić, G. Petrović, G. Ćirjanić. Innovative creative experience of artists testifies to a special sophistication, content, accuracy of design and diversity and comprehensibility of meaning-ful potential, which brings the manifestations of the poetics of syncretism of arts to the organisational components of the poetics of novels in general.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",23,2022

All rights reserved.Jude the Obscure (1895) is traditionally interpreted as Thomas Hardy’s bleakest and most pessimistic novel. From the perspective of ecocriticism, it may be viewed as the author’s endeavour to challenge the dominant anthropocentric attitude of the nineteenth century. Relying on Darwin’s theory of the common origin of species, Hardy believed that people should recognise their connectedness and dependence on the whole living world. The novel implies that man should abandon his self-centeredness and embrace other perspectives. This, however, does not mean that Hardy does not see people as valuable and important. In a world where religion loses its power we should rely on other people. The implication of Jude the Obscure is that the way we treat each other is linked to the way we treat nature. Hardy’s pessimism is the consequence of his realisation that ideas of Darwin were manipulated and (mal)adjusted to society. The character of Jude Fawley is doomed to tragedy due to his hypersensitivity, which is incorrectly perceived as a flaw in the society which promotes autonomy and separateness instead of connectedness and mutual dependence.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",21,2022

All rights reserved.Mongolia, as one of the geographical and semantic centerpieces of Central Asia, has remained in focus of Finno-Ugric, Altaic and Turkic studies for several generations. Expeditions and academic publications in the 1840s–1910s were given special attention due to growing political tension in a strategically important region, where the interests of the “Great Powers”, Japan and China, converged. The search for Oriental rarities and negotiations with the leaders and religious figures of Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang took place against the backdrop of tense social situation in a multiethnic and multiconfessional land. Mongolia, the Mongolian language and ethnoculture have gained prominence in the scholarly discourse of Finno-Ugric studies. By looking into Mongolian materials, Finnish and Hungarian researchers have tried either to confirm or to disprove the linguistic and ethnogenetic closeness of their own ethnicities to the Central Asian cultures of the past. M.A. Castrén and A. Csoma de Kőrös had paved the first roads of research to the East, after which the expeditions of J.R. Aspelin, H. Vámbéry, A.O. Heikel, K.G. Mannerheim, G.J. Ramstedt and J.G. Granö followed. A leading role in the organization of field research in Southern Siberia, Altai and Mongolia was played by the Finnish-Ugric Society, established in 1883, and its longstanding Chairman, Professor O. Donner. Studying the oral poetry, literary and monumental heritage of Mongolia, scholars have directly or indirectly touched upon the issues of ethnic identity and self-representation of contemporary Finno-Ugric peoples. In this case, the scholarly dialogue was combined with discussions on domestic politics and international affairs at the same expedition tent.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",68,2022

These expressions are compared with respect to their frequency in the papers and the degree to which metaphorical vocabulary is present in analysed research papers. The results indicate that all authors have used conceptual metaphors, although papers in Serbian include a slightly larger number of expressions than papers in English. Apart from differences and diversities, the analysis also identifies a remarkably similar structure of the mapping in both languages.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",37,2022

In order to identify the arealogical characteristics of Serbian vocabulary and identify isoglosses passing through the territory of Serbian dialects, in conversations with dialect speakers from various regions of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro, and in some cases per-sonally by dialect speakers, questionnaires were filled out based on lexical questions of the Serbo-Croatian Dialect Atlas. The article describes the lexical features of the dialects of two settlements located in southeastern Herzegovina – Ljubinje and Djedići (In addition to the Herzegovina vil-lages described in the work, material from another 20 Serbian settlements in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia, as well as several Croatian ones, is involved in the analysis.). The article highlights the following characteristics of Southeast Herzegoviаn vocabulary: 1) the preservation of Proto-Slavic archaisms, characteristic of the peripheral areas of the Central Slavic area; 2) the use of words characteristic of the west of the Central Slavic area and uncharacteristic of its eastern part; 3) the use of words characteristic of the regions near the Adriatic coast; 4) the widespread use of lexical doublets, namely the use of words with different areal characteristics in the dialect. Based on the comparison of questionnaires from Ljubinje and Djedići with questionnaires from other researched points, we can distinguish several types of areas, which include south-eastern Herzegovina. 1) the south-western area; 2) the east Herzegovian area: unity with the dialect of the village of Mosorovići; 3) the western area; 4) the peripheral (in the broad sense of the word, including the dialects west of Drina and the dialects of (south) eastern Serbia); 5) Bosnian-Slavonian 6) eastern (uniting the dialects of eastern Her-zegovina, Bosnia and Serbia).

All rights reserved.The development of onomastic theory in national and international contexts brings new impulses and pressures on the existing terminological system, including the unequal use of specific terms and the relationships between them. In Slavic hydronomastics, both established national and international terms are used, and others are continually emerging, with some in competition with existing ones. In order for the terminological system to fulfil its tasks, the long-term goal should be to harmonize it in both national and international contexts. In this paper, we discuss the development and status of hydronomastic terminology in the Slavic context. We propose and justify possibilities for the functional elimination of hierarchical and definitional disproportions of the terms of marine and oceanic toponymy, namely oceanonym, pelagonym, talasonym, bationym. In Slavic onomastics, the names of inland water objects are divided into potamonyms, limnonyms and helonyms (formerly also baltonyms). The creation and use of synonymous terms to existing established terms (∗paludonym to helonym) may be considered inappropriate. Only time will reveal the usefulness of other emerging hydronomastic terms (∗krenonym, ∗glacionym, etc.) and the functionality of their inclusion in the terminological system. The term microhydronym as a type of microtoponym in some national onomastics covers the names of smaller standing and flowing waters (in Ukrainian onomastics, the term only refers to smaller standing waters), and it is used especially in East Slavic and partly also in South Slavic onomastics. However, such an understanding does not conflict with the above classification of hydronyms according to object types. The question remains whether the principles of creating an onomastic terminological system are current and if there is also a desire to harmonize onomastic terminology in the international context.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",61,2022

The language game is realized due to the actualization of manipulations with units of all levels of the language system. Different categories of onyms are also involved in the language game, this fact is motivated by the special pragmatic nature of their meaning. The study of creative speech represents an innovative approach to the description of the language which, although it has its traditional, partially developed methodology, is characterized by the uniqueness of expression in the system of anthroponyms. We state the emergence of creative onomastics as an independent linguistic direction, the unit of which is the anthroponym-createme. The language game with anthroponyms is clearly manifested in the discourse of the modern media. The purpose of this research is to represent the ways in which anthroponymic createmes function in modern Ukrainian and Russian journalistic discourse. Examples of manipulating the name of Russian President Vladimir Putin and modelling his media image are described. This anthroponym-createme became the stimulus for the creation of original connotations, semantic and word-forming derivation, pragmatic meanings, demonstrating the vector of its functional load. It has been proved that active methods of modelling a language game involving anthroponyms are (1) metaphorization and metonymization, (2) euphemism, (3) dysphemization, (4) crealized derivation, including graphic, (5) paraphrasing, (6) paronomasia, (7) actualization of several associative features, (8) realization of the phenomenon of precedent (manipulation of mythonyms, biblicals, folklore and other types of onyms), (9) collision of antonymous or (10) homonymous meanings. There is a combination of the above mechanisms of the creation of linguocreatemes: complex combinations of several methods in different variations. Generated occasional meanings create a diverse palette of speech tones (ironic, low, contemptuous, humorous, sarcastic, etc.), stipulating a range of emotions and feelings, representing axiological meanings with varying degrees of expression.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",17,2022

This study responds to the call for greater use of parsed corpora by using automated parsing and refined corpus analysis software to investigate advanced EFL learners’ use of relative and participial clauses for nominal postmodification. The use of clausal postmodifiers inside the noun phrase may be seen as a marker of proficiency and syntactic maturity in academic writing, but the proportional use of relative and participial clauses for nominal postmodification may also be subject to L1 transfer. To investigate the role of transfer and syntactic maturity in the use of nominal postmodification, we compare texts written by Dutch EFL learners with those produced by learners from typologically distinct L1s, i.e. Czech and French, and by native speakers of English. Use of participial clauses and relative clauses in Dutch learners’ EFL texts is then compared with their use in L1 Dutch. The high degree of L1-interlanguage congruity suggests that transfer plays an important role in the Dutch learners’ strong preference for relative clauses for nominal postmodification. Based on the comparison with both other learner groups, we hypothesize that such transfer effects in the use of clausal postmodification can only emerge once the learner has reached a sufficient level of syntactic maturity in the target language.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",43,2022

Specific features of the representation of the gender component in the urbanonymicons of the eastern Belarusian city of Vitebsk and Рolish Bialystok are determined. The report shows general and specific aspects in the sets of “female” and “male” names of the linear objects of the Vitebsk urbanonym system in comparison with theof Bialystok. The presence of specific gender features is stated both at the level of qualitative content and the statistical structure of the system of names of intracity objects. In particular, information about the proportion of the manifestation of the presence of people of different sex in it is of a significant nature, with assessments attributed to men and women. In the body of memorial names of streets, squares, squares, the priority of the masculine principle is manifested: “feminine” is correlated with “masculine” in Vitebsk as 1 to 8.5; in Bialystok - 1 to 8.3. The absence in the Vitebsk list of the spheres of the activity of men, whose names served as the basis for naming the linear and territorial objects such as categories as church and religious figures and saints, kings, princes, representatives of a noble family, literary characters and the names of literary works serves as proof of the existing differences in the use of male names to create urbanonyms and their connection with the historical and cultural differences between the Belarusian and Polish societies, in particular, the disappearance of the privileged class of nobles and the titles of rulers as a result of the establishment of Soviet power in Belarus, as well as the greater attention of Poles to their national culture and literature. It is emphasized that a consideration of urbanonymous picture of the world in the gender paradigm can contribute to the disclosure of gender stereotypes that exist in modern culture, as well as the establishment of a specific cultural and historical content, one invested in jointly by Belarusians and Poles in understanding reality.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",16,2022

In this study, we investigate lexico-grammar, fluency, and prosody in LINDSEI (German, Czech, and Spanish) alongside British and American English comparable corpora, using multidimensional analysis, a statistical procedure that identifies co-occurring linguistic features and leads to functional interpretation of the discourse. Results show significant differences between L1 and L2 groups on four of six dimensions and reveal novel patterns of co-occurrence. Dimension 1, for example, identifies correlates of informationally driven discourse on all three linguistic levels under investigation. These findings show the importance of including multiple linguistic levels in the analysis of learner discourse and have implications for a more holistic and functionally based approach to language instruction.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",56,2022

James Gregor’s search for fascism in the Global South",Acta Academica,"[('Universität Siegen', 'Siegen', 'Germany')]","© Phillip Becher.After his commitment to the eventually failed defence of segregation in the United States during the 1960s, political scientist A. James Gregor (1929-2019) created an extensive oeuvre on the history of Fascism and its ideology. While personally remaining an éminence grise, his ideo-centric approach proved influential in international academic discussions. He helped foster an approach centred on the representation of ideological aspects of Fascism at the expense of the critical analysis of other historical elements, thus obscuring Fascism’s societal roots. Moreover, Gregor’s definition of Fascism, intrinsically linked to his understanding of a developmental dictatorship, blurs the line between colonialism and anticolonial struggles. In his works on Fascism in the Global South, written during the Cold War, Gregor does not find developmental regimes akin to the Mussolini dictatorship among the largely pro-Western right-wing authoritarianisms that emerged in the Tricont, but rather within the largely left-wing national liberation fronts and the political systems they built up. This peculiar verdict is linked to Gregor’s own apologia of historical Italian Fascism and more recent right-wing dictatorships in the so-called Third World, like, for instance, the Apartheid regime, and to his simultaneous denigration of anticolonial struggle as it was pursued i.a. by the anti-Apartheid movement. Through a critique of ideology which delineates and analyses Gregor’s argument evolving around these themes, this article contests his political compass in his search for Fascism in a historical-critical manner and offers an alternative proposition on how to identify the historical and contemporary role of far-right politics in the world system of capitalism.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",87,2022

All rights reserved.The continuing rise of right-wing populisms and fascism across the globe, mobilised by various factors such as the use of social technologies and the weaponisation of nationalism, xenophobia, sexism and racism – to name a few – provokes important questions in terms of resistance. Moreover, given that the lines between the new populisms and fascism are becoming increasingly nebulous, it is imperative that we at least attempt to better understand the conditions – including the more hauntological, which is to say historically and structurally invisibilised – from which algorithmic governmentality and its corollary, recursive conduct, are born. On that account, I unpack two understandings of fascism, first tracing it macropolitically through the work of Hannah Arendt and, thereafter, looking at its more micropolitical and libidinal aspects vis-à-vis the work of Deleuze and Guattari. I do so because it is my contention that there is a historical correlation between Arendt’s theorisation of a generalised espionage and our contemporary surveillance systems, as well as between Deleuze and Guattari’s theorisation of desire and the harnessing of affect through machine learning methods and their deployment via social media platforms, all of which aid the propagation of certain forms of populism – and even fascism. This is what I call algopopulism: algorithmically aided politics that transforms the ‘we’ into the ‘they’ through what can be thought of as recursive conduct or the digital exercise of power and its structuring of the field of possible action and thought. In turn, I link this to Stiegler’s understanding of negative sublimation, a paralysis of the human spirit which occurs due to, among other things, the generalised proletarianisation of knowledge, ultimately provoking the short-circuiting of processes of transindividuation. Finally, I offer some notes on resistance.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",48,2022

Publisher: Institute of Polish Language, Polish Academy of Sciences.The article describes the role, significance and functioning of proper names in the literary communication of Agnieszka Zimnowodzka seen as components of naming strategies enhancing the development of the creativity of young readers. The description of the functioning of proper names in regard to their harmony with the text was based on three interpretative levels – the pragmatic, stylistic and psychological. A detailed examination of the proper names revealed that they activate various functions in the text – the allusive, axiological, creative, cognitive, didactic, emotional, expressive-stylistic, informative, ludic and referential. Two superior strategies were distinguished among the naming strategies used in the short stories by the discussed writer: 1) the strategy of the semantic association of names from various onymic categories, and 2) the contextual naming strategy that brings about particular communication situations. An analysis of the proper names taken from short stories for children written by Zimnowodzka showed many innovative solutions in the field of using the categorial properties of proper names in the literary sphere. These naming formations not only make the reading easier and more attractive to young recipients but also enhance their creativity in many developmental dimensions.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",29,2022

Roma from Bohemia were deported to Lety and Roma from Moravia to the camp near Hodonín u Kunštátu, before most of them were murdered in the “Gypsy family camp” (Zigeunerlager) in Auschwitz II. Birkenau. The lists of prisoners are valuable not only for historians (they were published previously by the historian Ctibor Nečas), but also for onomastics, as they allow us to analyse the naming practise of Czech and Moravian Roma in the pre-war period. There are 325 unique surnames on these lists, with most of them being Czech or German, and they thus demonstrate the connection with the territory and its language(s). The study discusses the most common Roma surnames in Moravia (e.g. Daniel, Holomek, Burianský) and in Bohemia (e.g. Růžička, Janeček, Vrba) as well as the surnames of Sinti living in the Czech borderland regions (e.g. Winter). It is shown that the surnames of Roma from Bohemia and Moravia were different due to the historical and social reasons. They were mostly derived from personal names (e.g. Florián) and place names (e.g. Dubský), they were motivated by the occupation adopted (e.g. Kovář ‘smith’) or the character and appearance of the individual (e.g. Malík ‘small’). After the war, only 583 of the 4,870 Roma who had been imprisoned returned.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",33,2022

Komisji Edukacji Narodowej', 'Krakow', 'Poland')]","© by the author.Proper names derived from the nexus of the ancient Graeco-Roman tradition, namely of Greek and Latin languages, are due to cultural and identity-related reasons a vital component of the contemporary Polish language namespace. These onyms mostly belong to such varieties of Polish as academic, literary/bookish, and are mostly written. In onomastics they are considered transmitters of modern-day popular culture among whose products features the crime novel aimed at the mass reader. The present exploration or first approximation, with its qualitative rather thsn quantitative (statistical) character, sets out to try to present, arrange, classify, and describe the ways in which a recipient is onymically referred to the cultures of antiquity within Marek Krajewski’s eight crime stories, paying particular attention to their functional aspect and onymic status. The research should form part of cultural onomastics and literary onomastics as well as other linguistic disciplines such as lexicology and phraseology/phrasematics. The excerpts of the novels contain: (a) onyms of ancient origin used in their primary sense to identify and differentiate the referents associated with the culture of classical antiquity (e.g. the personal names of the men of culture of Antiquity and of philosophy); (b) proper names based on onyms or appellatives deriving from classical languages and antiquity; (c) ancient eponymisms, or common names taken at their root from ancient nomina propria, appellative derivatives stemming from Greek or Latin onyms among them; and (d) eponymous phrasemes incorporating either onyms of ancient pedigree or the appellatives and derivatives they gave rise to. The linguistic tapestry thus reviewed is a testimony to antiquity’s impact on Polish, whose facets clearly reflects its multicultural and intertextual nature. At the same time, it displays how antiquity is received in Polish culture as an ongoing process but here of the popular sort.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",22,2022

The material base consists of posts published on the fan page Lidl Polska via Facebook in 2020–2021, in which proper names have become the basis of language games. The analysis of formal procedures has shown that the most frequently used are contamination of propria with appellatives, while the replacement of an element in a multi-component proper name is equally eagerly used. Modifications consisting of phonetic and semantic manipulations, as well as the reduction of the segment of a several-element onymic unit, are much less common. The use of several transformations at the same time has also been frequently observed. In decoding advertising slogans and assessing the functionality of treatments, an important role is played by the connotative value of the names used for language games. The positive connotations associated with the proper name are to be transferred to the advertised product. First of all, various types of chrematonyms are transformed. For language games, not only are the names of well-known artistic works, music groups and places used, but also onyms that are recognizable by a narrower group of recipients.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",13,2022

After establishing detailed, practical information about the grammar of the names (declination), the goal of the next step was to include etymological information. Instead of a scholarly repository of the entire onomas-tic knowledge about Sorbian names, the aim was to create a bilingual (Lower Sorbian and German) information service for a broader public. However, this requires much more basic information than would be necessary for an onomastician. When, how, and why Sorbian names were coined has to be explained not just in general, but also in connection with individual names. This includes information about the reasons for names, the role of the various suffixes the names were created with, and so on. To compile this extensive information, which not only presents the etymology of the basic morphemes but also full explanations of names, specific text modules were developed for all phenomena and aspects concerning multiple names. For example, an article about one name consists of a specific text about this name along with several of the text modules dealing with, for instance, the suffix and the semantic group to which the name belongs.

The present article deals with the onomastic material preserved in Georgian Muhajirs’ speech in the Düzce region (Düzce İli).

Bearing in mind the multicultural context of the project, the Institute had to address several issues concerning, for example, the functional relationship between the Sorbian and German variants of a proper name, spelling standardisation (e.g. surnames), the lack of compatible word-formation processes, or a multilingual user interface. Additionally, the Institute intends to upgrade the resources of the section with exonyms and other types of onyms.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective review of all proximal humerus fractures at a single DGH during 1 year before ProFHER (2014) and 1 year following publication (2018). Data related to demographics, fracture pattern, and management was collected from electronic patient records and analysed. RESULTS: 52 patients in 2014 and 70 patients in 2018 met the inclusion criteria. There was no significant difference in demographics or fracture classification. Fewer patients were admitted from Accident and Emergency in 2018 (44% vs 55%). Of patients admitted, there was no significant difference between the proportion referred to a shoulder surgeon (SS) (27.5% vs 30%). In patients seen initially in fracture clinic by a non-shoulder surgeon (NSS), significantly fewer were referred for a SS opinion in 2018 (6.7%) vs 2014 (50%). Computed tomography was requested in 5/52 cases (9.6%) in 2014 and 8/70 cases (11.4%) in 2018, all cases involved an SS. Significantly more patients (14/52, 27%) were managed surgically in 2014 compared to 2018 (10/70, 14%).

Epidemiological data, demographic data, treatment methods, hospital stay duration, and injury-to-surgery time were analyzed. RESULTS: The total number of patients hospitalized for ankle fractures in the evaluated pandemic period was lower by 34% than that in the corresponding prepandemic period in 2019.

Therefore, the protection of this is a prerequisite for maintaining the condition of each joint. The assessment of the presence of articular cartilage is shown by X-ray of both joints in the standing position. Cartilage protection is possible for 1, 2 and 3 degree of cartilage damage according to the Kellgren and Lawrence scale.The challenge for the physician is to identify the cause of OA in accordance with the principles of Evidence Based Orthopedics/Traumatology, and not merely treat symptomatically, which is usually ineffective.In order to objectively present treatment methods, indications and the period of their implementation, it is biologically reasonable to refer to the needs of cartilage tissue resulting from the analysis of the causes of its damage and indications for justified methods of its protection.Biomechanical and biological elements are important in the process of implementing articular cartilage protection.The biomechanical elements are: limb axis disorders, differences in length, distortions at the level of the support quadrilateral, pelvic triangle and shoulder triangle, as well as balance disorders resulting from disturbances in the segmental proportion of the Fi number according to Leonardo da Vinci.There are many biological elements of the discussed disorder and they concern: the state of articular cartilage structure, matrix structure, matrix biophysical elements, molecular sponge mechanism, chondrocytes, cartilage nutrition and the severity of osteoarthritis (OA).The improvement of the conditions of the biological elements of damaged articular cartilage is considered fundamental and concerns the positive impact on numerous cartilage matrix proteins by chondroprotection. This element of treatment consists in the use of chondroitin sulphate and glucosamine as a drug, administered together in the appropriate dose and for a long time depending on the degree of degradation of the articular cartilage, usually from several to several months. The combination of chondroitin sulfate with glucosamine causes the activation of a much larger number of matrix proteins than each of the preparations separately.The pharmacokinetics of chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine are positive and favor their chondroprotective effect.The pharmacoproteomics of chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine administered together result from the activation of as many joint cartilage matrix proteins as possible. The development of proteomic techniques creates completely new therapeutic possibilities and is used to study the action of individual molecules.A clinically significant fact is that both chondroitin and glucosamine are natural, endogenous components of bone tissue and articular cartilage, so the use of both drugs is biologically compatible and results in numerous elements of cartilage protection.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",null,2022

CMC-1 arthritis produces several non-specific symptoms, affecting mainly postmenopausal women. The risk of developing CMC-1 arthritis increases with age.Considering these facts, knowledge about the etiopathogenesis and diagnosis of CMC-1 arthritis should be widely disseminated and based on evidence-based medicine. The first step in the diagnostic work-up is a detailed history and clinical examination where the use of more sensitive tests than the grind test, e.g. the pressure-shear test, is recommended. It is advisable to widen the classic radiographic views with additional thumb projections such as Roberts view.

We focus here on some understudied predictors of third person perception about fake news detection, such as diversity of media diet and belief in conspiracy theories. By means of a national survey (N=1006) conducted in Romania in October 2020, we test this effect for close and distant others, and the role both mainstream and online media play in this context. Main findings show that frequency of news consumption, trust in the media, and belief in conspiracy theories decrease the perceptual gap between self and others, while education and the diversity of the media diet intensifies it.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",63,2022

All rights reserved.The article deals with a controversial question on the character of royal women’s sacral role in the context of the divine queenship concept. As queenship is seen in contemporary Egyptology as an essential constituent element of the kingship ideology, the sacral role of the royal women is frequently determined as similar or even parallel to that of the king. In particular, sacral scenes with the images of the royal women performing the rites together with a king or alone are sometimes considered an illustration to this interpretation. As the author of the present article suggests, this approach needs re-еvaluation, which should be based on a careful examination of all surviving scenes depicting cult activity of the royal women. Among other issues, the author discusses the sacral role played by Nefertiti, whose official position differs considerably of that of other royal women. A preliminary study of figurative and epigraphical sources, especially with scenes showcasing the royal women, allowed the author to assume that in the majority of cases they played an auxiliary and secondary role. Indeed, since the Ramesside period, the royal women have been most frequently depicted shaking the sistrum/sistra – an auxiliary action in the divine cult. Thus, the thesis about the great king’s wife (or the king’s mother)’s role as a counterpart of the king in his cult functions should be revised, if not rejected.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",56,2022

When groups of speakers from different cultures use the same language, they may use different terms to evoke the same situation. At the same time, groups of speakers using different languages, but close in their cultures (for example, French-speaking Belgians and Dutch-speaking Belgians), may use quasi-equivalent terms. To understand what differentiates two cultures, it is very useful to compare the ways in which the same situation is put into words. The differences between the English and French versions of the text of the International Convention on the Rights of the Child provide a good illustration of this fact.

Such a synthetic advance points to a new direction for resolving the chicken-egg dilemma of how the early life forms were hosted: without a physical barrier it would be difficult to maintain organized reactions, but without organized reactions, it would be difficult to create a cell membrane. In our synthesis, the divalent cation Ca2+ plays a critical role in the co-precipitation and in creating hollow compartments after simple dilution with water. The precursor of silica, poly(silicic acid), is a negatively charged, cross-linked polymer. It could be co-precipitated with negatively charged biopolymers such as DNA and proteins, whereas the remaining silica precursor forms a conformal and microporous shell on the surface of the initial precipitate.

In this work, multi-mode anti-counterfeiting is guaranteed from a single luminescent material CaCd2Ga2Ge3O12:Tb3+,Yb3+via a high-temperature solid-state reaction. The experimental result showed that this single material features green luminescence with excellent photoluminescence, afterglow, thermoluminescence, and up-conversion luminescence, which are ascribed to Tb3+ transitions. Upon co-doping with Yb3+ as a sensitiser, the photo-stimuli responsiveness was achieved at 254 and 980 nm excitation sources, respectively, and the thermo-stimuli responsiveness was realised after exposure to UV of 254 nm for 10 s and heating at 45 °C, respectively. The band structure calculation, trap distribution, and effective trap depths were used to explain the luminescence mechanism.

Unfortunately, pure aluminium cannot give a required tensile strength, whereas by adding some other materials like particles of silicon carbide can give a proper strength and converted into a composite with adequate properties which is most suitable in the manufacturing of some specific biomedical instruments. It is well known that size and spatial distributions of particles are both influential in determining the mechanical properties of composite materials and, therefore, statistical characterization of these distributions is of prime importance if we wish to control the quality of the manufacturing processes for these materials. Many researchers have considered quantitative analysis of these features separately, but here we investigate the relationship between size and spatial distribution of the particles over an aluminium matrix. We have considered the actual sizes simply as ‘large’ or ‘small’ and, consequently, the characterization of the particle distribution patterns in the aluminium matrix can be carried out using statistical methods based on the theory of bivariate spatial point processes. We have applied this statistical approach to a sample of an aluminium alloy reinforced with silicon carbide particles. It is shown that the methods provide a complete characterization on the spatial interaction between small and large silicon carbide particles and it can be successfully used in a quality control step for the production of particulate composite materials used in the manufacturing of biomedical instruments.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",36,2022

The layers under consideration have a simply connected free surface and rotational symmetry with respect to the line of action of the angular velocity. The mathematical formulation of this problem is reduced to a system of first-order ordinary differential equations with boundary and integral closing conditions. A new algorithm for the numerical solution of the resulting system is proposed, the influence of various dimensionless parameters on the characteristics of equilibrium droplet shapes is studied, and criteria for the existence of such shapes are determined. The paper is of theoretical interest, since the problem under consideration is one of the fundamental ones in the research of capillary phenomena. The developed numerical scheme can also be applied in a wider class of differential equations. The results of the article can be used in practical tasks related to coating, fiber and powder production by the centrifugal-disk method.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",11,2022

The objective was to identify demographic, socioeconomic and health factors that influenced the reduction of fertility levels in the 1,262 municipalities that compose the Brazilian Semi-arid region, in the period 1991-2010. The application of the panel data regression model showed that the reduction in the Gini Index and the Illiteracy Rate and also the increase in Life Expectancy at Birth and in the Aging Rate contributed significantly to the decrease in fertility levels in the Semi-arid region. The results indicated that fertility levels converged in the period towards a regional homogenization close to the replacement level, which declined at a faster pace than the improvement in the region's levels of development.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",38,2022

In the particular case of gliomas, highly heterogeneous brain tumors at the histological, cellular and molecular levels, and exhibiting poor prognosis, the mechanisms behind tumor heterogeneity and progression remain poorly understood. The recent advances in biomedical high-throughput technologies have allowed the generation of large amounts of molecular information from the patients that combined with statistical and machine learning techniques can be used for the definition of glioma subtypes and targeted therapies, an invaluable contribution to disease understanding and effective management.

Next, it is necessary to solve two linear differential equations of arbitrary order for analytical functions in two different regions of the complex plane. The corresponding fundamental systems of solutions are found, after which the method of variation of arbitrary constants is used for the solution.

However, some conditions, such as the presence of a cure fraction, characterized when an unknown por-tion of the population is no longer at risk of developing the event of interest, can lead to the non-adequacy of the model. Therefore, the presence of a cure fraction requires an extension in the standard form of the logistic regression model or the use of an alternative one. The present work aims to identify risk factors for the presence of External Inflammatory Root Resorption (EIRR) using a real application. The data set consisted in replanted permanent teeth referred to treatment at the Dental Trauma Clinic of the School of Dentistry from the Federal University of Minas Gerais (DTC-SD-UFMG) after emergency care at the Metropolitan Hospital Odilon Beherns in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. A logistic regression type model is considered to study the association between clinical and radiographic factors and the presence/absence of EIRR, measured radiographically at the first patient appointment at DTC-SD-UFMG. Considering that EIRR is only expected in those cases where the root canal become infected following pulp necrosis, those teeth whose pulp healing is favorable are not at risk of developing EIRR. However, pulpal status usually can only be defined in the long term, such that information is not available at the time of data collection, characterizing the presence of a latent cure fraction. Moreover, in the present sample some patients contributed with more than one replanted tooth, forming clusters of correlated measurements. In the present work we followed the methodology proposed by Hall & Zhang (2004) in which they used an adaption of the EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm, called ES (Expectation-Solution) algorithm combined with GEE (Generalized Estimation Equations) to accommodate the cluster (individual) multivariate response in a logistic cure fraction model.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",15,2022

The coffee fruit has a double sigmoidal growth pattern, however, as well as in other fruits that also show such a growth pattern, the authors generally do not estimate parameters of regression models to describe such curve. In the study of fruit growth curves, the sample size is generally small, so the estimation of the parameters should preferably be done by the Bayesian methodology, since a priori information is incorporated, reducing the effects of having few observations. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms are the most used computational tool in Bayesian statistics. However, these generate dependent samples, can be complicated to implement and, mainly, to teach. There are also other alternatives to the MCMC algorithms to obtain approximations of integrals of interest in Bayesian inference, the main ones are based on the importance resampling techniques. The objective of this work is to use Bayesian inference with the weighted importance resampling technique in the estimation of parameters of double sigmoidal nonlinear regression models to the description of coffee fruit growth. The double nonlinear logistic model was used in the description of the accumulation of fresh weight in coffee fruits. All prioris used have Beta distribution and were obtained by the called prior of specialist technique. Bayesian methodology was efficient, since it provided parameters with practical interpretation to coffee fruit growth, consistent with the reality. Thus, Bayesian inference by weighted importance resampling was a good alternative for the parameters estimation of nonlinear double sigmoid regression models. The logistic model showed that the growth of coffee fruits is more intense in the first sigmoid (until 162 DAF) of the growth curve and stabilizes in its final weight after 262 daf.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",35,2022

The prepared electrode presented high sensitivity, a wide linear range, excellent repeatability and multi-day detection stability as a result of high content of pyridinic nitrogen in the N-C@Cu/Nafion/GCE. Under the optimized experimental parameters, the detection range was from 4 to 1400 μM and the limit of detection was 2.98 μM (S/N = 3). The N-C@Cu sensor has also been successfully used for detecting H2O2 in environmental water samples and domestic products.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",74,2022

It discusses most important issues related thereto, including the organizational model of the above-mentioned cooperatives and the way it is to be shaped, taking into account the prohibition of replacing the general assembly with a meeting of representatives. The article also presents the specific legal nature of a general assembly divided into parts and specific solutions related thereto which apply in the process of adopting resolutions. In this context, the analyse includes submitting a resolution to voting of all parts of the general assembly as well as obtaining in the voting process a majority of the total number of members participating in the general assembly. Next, the exception to the prohibition of adopting resolutions on matters not included in the agenda, resulting from the general provisions of the cooperative law, is discussed and the issue of whether this exception applies also to housing cooperatives is analysed. An attempt was also made to interpret the provisions regulating technical aspects of the notice of convening the general assembly. Moving on to further aspects, the article also refers to the issue of appealing against resolutions of the general assembly of housing cooperatives and discusses the group of persons authorized to bring an action for declaring the resolution invalid or an action for an annulment of a resolution. Finally, although this issue was not addressed by the Supreme Court yet, this article also analyses the so-called alternative methods of adopting resolutions by the general assembly in epidemic periods.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",17,2022

All rights reserved.Given the increase in the informal economy in developing countries economies, a better understanding of the effect of the informal economy on environmental degradation is essential for policy makers. The aim of this study is to examine the impact of the informal economy (IFE) on the ecological footprint (EFP) in Saudi Arabia during the period 1981-2017. An autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) was used to test the long-term relationship between the examined variables. It determined which variable was causally related to the other using Granger causality analysis. The long-run coefficients of ARDL showed that the IFE had a positive influence on ecological footprint in Saudi Arabia in the long run. In contrast, EFP can increase the informal economy. The Granger causality based on VECM approach shows bi-directional causality between EFP and IFE in the short run and the long run. Therefore, the findings of this study can help policy makers in Saudi Arabia and a number of countries with a large informal sector to better understand the role of governance in reducing the IFE in order to improve the environmental quality.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",43,2022

All rights reserved.Magnetic-valve controllable reactor (MCR), as an important reactive power compensation device, is widely used in power system. Due to the nonlinear characteristics of its core saturation, a large number of harmonics will be generated. This paper presents a curvilinear MCR and its harmonic optimization method to minimize harmonic output; meanwhile, a general harmonic mathematical model of MCR is derived. The model shows that the ratio of maximum cross-sectional area to minimum cross-sectional area and shape of the magnetic valve determine the harmonic content. The principle of harmonic optimization is described in detail, and the constraint of area ratio on harmonic optimization is derived by a variational method. The simplified evaluation function of total harmonic distortion rate is obtained by the Gauss Legendre integral, and the numerical solution of the optimal curvilinear magnetic valve under different area ratios is obtained by combining the particle swarm optimization algorithm. The optimal curvilinear magnetic valve obtains the lowest harmonic output of MCR. The area ratio of 2.7 is taken as an example, and the curvilinear magnetic valve is compared with the multi-stage magnetic valve in theory, simulation and experiment. The total harmonic of the curvilinear magnetic valve is about 2.92%, which meets the industry standard, while the multi-stage magnetic valve is about 3.12%, which does not meet the standard. Finally, the superiority and correctness of the method in this paper are verified.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",25,2023

All rights reserved.The transient disturbance signals scattered throughout the power system are not easily captured by the substation monitoring equipment. Therefore, high frequency current transformers (HFCTs) installed in the cable accessories were used as the source of high-speed signal acquisition to realize the identification of transient disturbance signals in this paper. Firstly, transient disturbance signal sampling experiments were conducted using real HFCT samples, demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of HFCT in collecting transient disturbance signals. Then, by in-depth analysis of the specific characteristics of the transient disturbance signal with prominent high frequency and weak signal after being filtered by the HFCT, a transient disturbance identification method based on multiple time-frequency feature matrices was proposed. A parameter-optimized variational modal decomposition was applied to deconstruct the high-frequency weak waveform signal into multiple components with different center frequencies, in which waveform characteristic matrix could be extracted. Besides, Wigner-Ville distribution time-frequency analysis was performed on different frequency components to obtain the time-frequency spectrum and to extract the time-frequency spectrum feature matrix of each component. Finally, the waveform feature matrix and the time-frequency spectrum feature matrix were combined to construct a multiple time-frequency feature matrix, which was input into the long short-term memory network for transient disturbance signal classification and identification. Tests using experimental data illustrate that the multiple time-frequency feature matrix proposed in this paper can fully mine the local details of high-frequency weak signals, and it is suitable for the classification and identification of transient disturbance signals filtered by HFCT with dramatic anti-noise performance. The method proposed in this paper provides a novel monitoring idea and method for the classification and identification of transient disturbance signals.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",24,2023

Many new military lexemes, including numerous chrematonyms, have appeared in the speech of every Ukrainian. One of the most popular words of the Ukrainian military discourse in 2022 emerged from this class of proper names — the chrematonyms Javelin and Bayraktar, the semantics, pragmatics and functional load of which are analyzed in this study. The relevance of this work is determined by the fact that the phenomenon of chrematonymy is understudied and consists in a new anthropocentric approach to the study of the chrematonymy problem. The purpose of the article is to investigate the functioning of the specified proper names of weapons, to reveal their culturally informative cumulativeness, onymic potential and axiological possibilities in neonomination. It has been proven that the chrematonyms Javelin and Bayraktar turned from neologisms to commonly used words in a short time; they also occupied an important place in the system of onymic area, which is evidenced by their common knowledge, frequency of use, functioning in various styles of speech, Internet memes, and pop culture. The onomasiological approach made it possible to find out the productivity of the analyzed chrematonyms in the creation of new onyms, the relationship between onymic units in the process of their formation, as well as the socio-cultural determination of neonomination and appellativeization of proper names (de-onymization). It was established that the analyzed military chrematonyms are a source for the creation of new onyms (in particular, anthroponyms) as a result of a positive connotation caused by extralingual socio-cultural factors. A linguistic-cultural approach to chrematonyms opens up the perspective of studying the names of weapons as a cultural code, because weapons are one of the oldest artifacts created by man.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",12,2023

These physicoempirical PTFs rely on the hypothesis of shape similarity between PSD and WRF, and do not require the calibration of the input parameters. In the first stage, twenty-seven PSD models were evaluated using 4,128 soil samples collected in Campania (southern Italy). These models were ranked according to the root mean square residuals (RMSR), corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc), and adjusted coefficient of determination (R2adj). In the second stage, three subsets of PSD and WRF data (DS-1, DS-2, and DS-3), comprising 282 soil samples, were used to evaluate the two PTFs using the best three PSD models selected in the first stage. The hypothesis of shape similarity was assumed as acceptable only when the RMSR value was lower than the field standard deviation of the WRFs (s*), which is viewed as a tolerance threshold and computed from the physically based scaling approach proposed by Kosugi and Hopmans (1998). In the first study area (DS1), characterized by a fairly uniform, loamy textured volcanic soil, the PTF-AH outperformed the PTF-MV and both PTFs provided reasonable performance within the acceptance threshold (i.e., RMSR < s*). In the other two heterogeneous field sites (DS-2 and DS-3, characterized by soil textural classes that span from clay and clay-loam to loam and even sandy-loam soils), the PTF-MV (with 3% to 6% RMSR surpassing s*) outperformed the PTF-AH (with 8% to 30% RMSR surpassing s*) and the majority of RMSR values were larger than those obtained in the original studies. The mean relative error (MRE) revealed that the PTF-MV systematically underestimates the measured WRFs, whereas the PTF-AH provided negative MRE values indicating an overall overestimation. The outcomes of our study provide a critical evaluation when using calibration-free PTFs to predict WRFs over large areas.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",78,2023

It also explores the similarities and/or differences between these relations and those identified by Jackendoff pertaining to English compounds. To this end, a corpus of Arabic compounds was collected and analysed to identify the type of conceptual basis on which both lexicalised and novel compounds are formed in Arabic. The analysis revealed that all conceptual relations found between elements of English compounds can also be found in Arabic, yet the direction of the head was different in the latter. The analysis also demonstrated that Arabic compounds exhibit other types of conceptual relations which were not mentioned by Jackendoff. It is suggested that both regular stored lexicalised compounds that have idiosyncratic interpretations and novel compounds (with the majority being formed based on Synthetic Genitive Construction) can be reconciled under the approach of Relational Morphology, as they can be generated by the same compound schema.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",34,2023

In this regard, this study can be classified as an example of microsociology because it departs from the general approach of conventional historiography by absorbing facts concerning grand political events and episodes. He was a self-made intellectual who explored in his writings formidable historical events concerning the migrant workers (koeli kontrak) in North Sumatra, and the Dutch War in Aceh. In addition, it was also pertinent to construct a framework to explain his ideas on the development of nationalism, and the factors that led to independence in the following decades. During the early 20th century, nationalism, identity, and nation-state were a patchwork, and had cleavages in many people’s minds in the Archipelago. Nevertheless, new discourses were developed to gain political consciousness and power through the writings of young journalists and intellectuals like Mohammad Said (MS). The thoughts and actions of MS should be considered as representing the values of his time. In this regard, one can assert that-in a Hegelian way-his self-consciousness helped the readers to comprehend the ‘spirit of the time.’ This study carried some glimpses of the era of tense discussions of independence, and anti-colonial struggles through MS’s intellectual discourse. This approach, namely viewing past political developments through the prism of a social agent, is essential.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",56,2023

The lack of a dependable power supplier and rising electricity costs force the public and businesses to look for alternatives to meet their energy needs. These alternatives are costly to implement and beyond the financial reach of most South Africans. The most common alternative energy source is solar photovoltaic systems with large battery banks to survive Eskom's long, regular load-shedding schedules. This research aims to design and simulate a combined solar-thermal and stored heat energy-powered Stirling engine for power generation. The output of the research simulation was compared to a standard photovoltaic installation of similar power output. The results for this paper were generated from the simulation software package MATLAB. Such a system must have a lower capital cost to compete with solar photovoltaic systems with battery backup.

However, various bacterial infections have been reported in poultry chickens, decreasing their production rate. Farmers have been using synthetic antibiotic agents to manage these infections, which are costly and have several side effects. One of the most commonly reported bacterial pathogens is Salmonella enteritidis, which causes high mortality and low poultry production. Mortality and illness rates are associated with gastrointestinal diseases caused by suboptimal absorption. This study was conducted to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effect of Chlorogenic acid (CGA) from robusta lampung green coffee extract on S. enteritidis infected chickens.

Developing rice varieties with drought tolerance is possible through chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs), which blend the genetic background of a high-yielding parent with specific chromosome segments from a donor parent. This study aimed to study the effect of drought stress on various root traits of chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs) and their relationship with specific molecular markers. Ninety-six genotypes, including 80 chromosome segment substitution lines (Curinga x O. rufipogon and Curinga x O. meridionalis), 9 New Rice for Africa (NERICAs) and 7 controls were grown in Basket and PVC pipe methods for phenotyping different root traits. Under drought stress (DS), MER16, MER20, RUF10, RUF16, RUF44, NERICA1, and NERICA3 showed superior performance for most of the root traits. These evaluations were supplemented with association analysis of 17 root trait-linked simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers with root phenotypic traits. The marker RM201 is strongly associated with multiple root traits, found to be independent of three growth conditions (well-watered “WW” under Basket, WW condition and DS conditions under PVC pipe). The marker RM316 is associated with root volume, and the marker RM7424 and RM1054 show maximum root length. In conclusion, these markers can be used in marker-assisted breeding programs, and the lines carrying them can be used as parental lines in variety-development programs for drought tolerance.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",57,2023

The structure of existential clauses with brakować ‘to lack’ differs from that of negative existential clauses with być ‘to be’ but resembles the structure of affirmative być ‘to be’ existential clauses. Both być ‘to be’ and brakować ‘to lack’ are treated as monadic predicates whose sole argument is a small clause, represented as PredP.

All rights reserved.Equine endometrosis is one of the major causes of equine infertility, often associated with signs of periglandular fibrosis occurring in the endometrium. As the oviduct is a key location of early embryo development, we hypothesized that disturbances in hormonal action may be associated with a loss of contact between mucosal cells in the uterus and oviducts. This study investigates the expression of intermediate filament proteins (vimentin and desmin), oestrogen receptor alpha (ERα), and progesterone receptor A (PRA) in the stroma and epithelia of the endometria and oviducts of healthy mares and mares with endometrosis. Endometrium samples were obtained from 56 mares, culled in a slaughterhouse, and were designated either healthy endometrium (n = 26) or endometrium with signs of moderate to severe endometrosis (n = 20). The phase of the ovarian cycle and the expression of vimentin, desmin, ERα, and PRA were compared between these groups. The expressions of both vimentin and desmin were higher in the endometrial stroma of the endometrosis group than in healthy endometria. The expression of ERα in the healthy endometrial stroma and luminal epithelium during the follicular phase was higher than in the luteal phase, but showed no differences in the endometrium of mares with endometrosis. PRA expression was significantly higher in the stoma oviduct during the follicular phase than in the luteal phase. It seems possible that mucosal cells may support the occurrence of moderate to severe endometrosis through their altered intermediate filament and sex steroid receptor interactions. In addition, the oviduct appears to be less sensitive to hormonal changes than the uterus. Changes in the expression of intermediate filament and steroid hormone proteins may be a leading factor contributing to the functional status of the oviduct in endometrosis.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",38,2023

Time-series analysis (1800-2019) of bigrams gauged each term’s frequencies of occurrence and changes in combinability with nouns for natural objects, artefacts, abstract concepts and figurative expressions. In frequency, koričnevyj overtook buryj in the 1920s, confirming its basic status in modern Russian. The perplexity index indicates that koričnevyj steadily increased the range of denoted objects, with artefacts being front runners in the buryj-to-koričnevyj transition. The results corroborate Rakhilina’s (2007a, 2007b, 2008) hypothesis that an incipient CT initially collocates with nouns denoting artefacts but gradually expands to the realm of natural objects supplanting an old CT.

In this paper, considering the influence of gravity, based on the ablation mechanism of radial current concentrated, the two structures are compared and analyzed by finite element simulation and simulation ablation experiments. The results show that the contact area between the flat aluminum sheath and the buffer layer under the influence of gravity is larger than that between the corrugated aluminum sheath and the buffer layer. The concentrated radial current caused by the bad contact is dispersed, and the temperature rise of the buffer layer is effectively reduced. Under the test current condition of 100 mA, the buffer layer temperature of corrugated aluminum sheath structure exceeds 278 ℃, and even the insulation shield is burned, while the buffer layer temperature of flat aluminum sheath structure is only 74 ℃. Compared with the corrugated aluminum sheath structure, the flat aluminum sheath structure has an advantage in inhibiting the ablation of buffer layer.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",36,2023

All rights reserved.Polyimide is often used as an insulating material for inverter motors due to its good thermal stability and electrical insulation properties, however, during its application, the charge traps generated by its conformational defects can trigger space charge effects when space charges are trapped under the influence of external factors, thus accelerating the aging of polyimide. Therefore, the microscopic behavior of polyimide molecules under the effects of electric field and temperature is simulated based on the density functional theory and molecular dynamics to help deeply analyze the trap depth of polyimide molecules, and the connection between molecular microscopic properties and electrical aging reaction is discussed using the transition state theory and free energy increment theory. The results show that, at electric fields of 0.1×1010 V/m to 0.4×1010 V/m, the polyimide molecules move directionally along the electric field, and their structures are orderly arranged; when the electric field is 0.5×1010 V/m, the molecular morphology is no longer maintained, resulting in free volume rearrangement, due to the electric field forces exceeding the intermolecular interaction forces of the polyimide. The energy bands of the polyimide molecules are tilted by the applied electric field and the trap depth deepens with increasing field strength. The thermal motion of the polyimide system intensifies under the effect of temperature, and the molecular chain segment movement space is stretched. Compared to the electric field, the increase in temperature leads to an overall decrease in the trap energy level, and the charge is more likely to be trapped at high temperatures. The electric aging reaction follows the transition state theory, and the electric field will change the microstructure of polyimide molecules and will increase the molecular vibration frequency, thus the free energy increment will change, which enables the aging reaction rate within the molecular system to accelerate. It is found that the free energy increment of polyimide system is approximately linear with the electric field, and grows with the temperature.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",41,2023

All rights reserved.The mechanism of heat transfer between supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO2) and liquid lead-bismuth alloy (LBE) coupled in a printed circuit heat exchanger (PCHE) is complex, and little research has been conducted on this topic. Therefore, this paper develops a three-dimensional model of a "" 1 correspond 2"" type straight channel PCHE heat transfer unit. A numerical simulation method is used to investigate the coupled heat transfer characteristics of S-CO2 and LBE. The results show that the S-CO2 convective heat transfer thermal resistance on the cold side is greater than the LBE thermal resistance on the hot side. This means that the overall heat transfer characteristics of PCHE are mainly enslaved to the effect of S-CO2, and the heat transfer strength of the S-CO2 side determines the lower limit of the overall heat transfer characteristics. Additionally, varying the inlet mass flow rate on the S-CO2 side has a greater effect on the power of the PCHE heat exchanger unit than varying the inlet mass flow rate on the LBE side. For each 1 kg/ s increase in the S-CO2 inlet mass flow rate, the heat transfer power increases by 335. 77 kW.

Through mathematical modeling of the universal lead(Pb) bismuth(Bi) eutectic advanced test loop, the thermohydraulic and corrosion deposition programs applicable to transient natural circulation were developed. The transient thermohydraulic behavior under typical operating conditions, such as transient start-up and step power change, and the corrosion precipitation distribution of the loop under oxygen-free and oxygen-controlled conditions are discussed.

Considering the difference between the simulated and measured spectra at the Compton plateau, the ratio method was established to modify the simulated spectrum according to the formation mechanism of γ spectrum, thereby generating a standard γ nuclide spectrum.

However, the investigation of parameter effects in the new synergistic pulsed tumor ablation technology is still in its early stages. In this study, the Hepa1-6 liver cancer cell line was utilized as the research subject. From the level of individual cells and 2D simulated tissue, combining cell viability assessments and fluorescent molecular probe technology to measure the ablation range, we systematically analyzed the influences of various parameters of synergistic pulses (pulse width, voltage, number, frequency, and interval time) on tumor cell killing effects (ablation area and activity rate) for the first time. A synergistic parameter combination that significantly improved the therapeutic outcome was proposed. The results demonstrated that the inhibitory effect on tumor cells was positively correlated with nanosecond pulse width (300~800 ns), voltage (ns pulse: 1.2~2 kV, μs pulse: 200~400 V), and the number of synergistic pulses, while being negatively correlated with frequency (0.1~100 Hz). The effect of interval time (1 μs~1 ms) was found to be insignificant. Based upon these findings, the first preclinical large animal test was conducted to further validate the feasibility of synergistic pulse tissue ablation. This research demonstrates that synergistic pulses can significantly enhance the therapeutic efficacy of irreversible electroporation ablation, and a dose-effect relationship between pulse parameters and treatment outcomes can be established.

The LLC converter operating at resonant frequency and the PWM converter provides a stable output voltage. However, there is a significant losses due to the PWM converter providing the full load power. In addition, the resonant frequency of the LLC converter usually deviates from the preset value because of the stray inductance, device consistency and other factors, resulting in the converter efficiency will be further reduced. For the above problem, a primary-side series-connected LLC converter topology is proposed. The output port of the Buck converter is connected in series with any bridge of the full-bridge LLC converter, and adjusting the output voltage of the Buck converter can change the input voltage amplitude of the resonant tank of the LLC converter. The Buck converter only needs to provide part of the load power to achieve wide voltage gain range regulation of the overall converter. For resonant frequency deviation, a frequency adaptive tracking method is proposed. Combining the operating characteristics of the LLC converter in different resonant states, the frequency regulation value can be calculated based on the secondary rectifier on-time. Finally, an experimental prototype with 240~380 V input and 28 V/1 kW output was built. The Buck converter provides only up to 45% of the load power, and the LLC converter can accurately track to the resonant frequency.

All rights reserved.Due to the long-term erosion of ocean currents, the submarine cable buried on the surface of the seabed tends to form suspended sections whose length and height gradually develop over time. When the suspended length of the submarine cable reaches a certain value, the shedding frequency of the vortex behind the cable will be close to the natural frequency of the cable, and frequency locking will occur. The amplitude of the submarine cable in the locked state is relatively large, which can easily lead to damage to the lead sheath. Therefore, in this paper, the coupling effect of downstream direction and transverse direction is taken into account, and a two-dimensional spring-damper vortex vibration model is established.Meanwhile, the slice method based on a nested grid is adopted to analyze the vortex-induced vibration response of the suspended submarine cable under the influence of different parameters. The simulation results show that the lateral displacement of ViV of the submarine cable is much larger than the amplitude of ViV in the downstream direction at the same reduced speed, whereas, the vibration frequency of ViV in the downstream direction is nearly twice that in the transverse direction. The maximum amplitude in the transverse direction of the cable is close to the diameter of the cable. The end restraint mode and suspension length mainly affect the minimum velocity of the cable entering the locked region but have a negligible influence on the maximum amplitude in the two directions.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",21,2023

All rights reserved.With the rapid development of medium and high voltage high-power inverters, more and more attention has been paid to reducing switching loss and improving system efficiency. The most common way is lowering switching frequency, which can lead to a deterioration of the harmonic performance of the output voltage. Applying specific harmonic elimination pulse width modulation (SHEPWM) can achieve a good harmonic performance at low switching frequencies. However, there is an inherent problem of neutral point potential imbalance when SHEPWM is applied to neutral point clamped (NPC) three-level inverters, which asks for an active balance control. To keep the good harmonic performance of SHEPWM at low switching frequencies, the existing methods of switch angle correction and redundant small vectors have to live with a weak ability on neutral point potential control. To overcome these shortcomings, an algorithm of neutral point potential balancing is presented in this paper, based on optimization of SHEPWM voltage vectors. By establishing the cost function of neutral point potential and traversing the voltage vectors, the switching state and action time are both corrected online, and the process of neutral point potential balancing is sped up. Experimental results show that, under a limited number of switching redundant small vectors and a fixed value of correcting switching angles, the proposed algorithm holds a shorter balancing time compared with the two existing methods above, and balances the switching frequency and balancing time at the same time.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",19,2023

The shape, electrical and optical characteristics of air plasma jet under various electrode arrangements and air flows, the physical and chemical properties and inactivation efficacy of PAW were investigated.

In response to this problem, this paper proposes a DC voltage balancing control strategy to achieve mutual-phase and inner-phase DC voltage balance between modules. Firstly, this paper proposes a zero-sequence compensation control scheme to solve the problem of mutual-phase DC voltage equalization. By constructing zero-sequence the component of the port voltage and analyzing the zero-sequence power distribution in the dq coordinate system, the linear relationship between mutual-phase DC voltage difference and zero-sequence voltage is established to control three-phase zero-sequence power and achieve the purpose of mutual-phase equalization. Subsequently, to solve the problem of inner-phase voltage equalization, this paper proposes a broadband load range voltage sharing algorithm that combines pulse width modulation and sorted voltage sharing modulation, enabling some modules to operate without load and improving the DC voltage sharing ability within the phase. Finally, a low-power experimental platform for the three-phase star cascade 9-module rectifier is established. The control algorithm is designed based on the FPGA controller, and the experiments verify the correctness and effectiveness of the control strategy proposed in this paper.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2023

All rights reserved.The problems of high redundancy of vibration signal and low accuracy of classification in the degradation stage exist in AC contactor contact system degradation, therefore,a method based on Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (SRCC) and fuzzy C-means clustering (FCM) is proposed to divide the degradation phase of the contact system. Firstly, the vibration signals of the opening and closing stages of the contact system throughout the life cycle are obtained through the full life test of the AC contactor, and the time domain and frequency domain characteristics reflecting the degradation state of the contacts are extracted from the results.Secondly, SRCC and principal component analysis are used to select feature and reduce feature dimensionality, and to construct performance degradation indicators. Thirdly, unsupervised learning (UL) FCM is introduced as a theoretical basis for dividing the contact system into 2 to 5 degradation stages. Finally, silhouette coefficient (SC), Calinski Harabasz score(CHS) and Dacies Bouldin index (DBI) are selected to evaluate the clustering effect internally, and five supervised classifiers are used to verify the accuracy of this method. The results show that the internal evaluation is the best when the contact system is divided into three degradation stages, the average recognition accuracy of five classifiers for the three degradation stages can reach 95.54%, and the degradation stage division is the most reasonable. The proposed method can be adopted to effectively solve the problem of signal redundancy and low accuracy of phase division, which can accurately realize the division of degradation phase of AC contactor contact system.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",32,2023

The effect of these fiber sources on the proximate composition, pH, titratable acidity, water activity, color, texture, total phenolic content, microbial load, and sensory acceptability of fruit snacks was determined. Results showed that fruit snacks enriched with inulin (5.0%) had the highest content of total dietary fiber while snacks enriched with carrot fiber (5.0%) had the highest total phenolic content. The moisture content of fruit snacks with different fibers decreased in comparison to control snacks as fiber was added into their formulation. Moreover, the water activity values of fruit snacks (aw) were lower than 0.7, indicating a low risk for bacterial growth and affirming a favorable shelf life. Compared to control snacks, increasing the dietary fiber addition from 2.5 to 5.0% significantly increased the hardness, gumminess and chewiness values of fruit snacks.

All rights reserved.To investigate the influence of precise surface modification of nano TiO2 on the DC electrical properties of silicone rubber(SIR), long and short chain polydimethylsiloxane(PDMS) were grafted onto the surface of nano TiO2 with monomodal and bimodal different densities, respectively. Nano TiO2 with different grafting types were added to SIR at the same mass fraction (1%) to produce nano TiO2/SIR composite film samples. The results of thermogravimetric analysis confirmed that long and short chain PDMS were successfully grafted onto the surface of nano TiO2. The Zeta potential test results indicated that bimodal grafting of long and short chain PDMS enhanced the electrostatic repulsion between adjacent TiO2 particles. TEM observations showed that the dispersibility of nano TiO2 in SIR was greatly improved by bimodal grafting of long and short chain PDMS. The results of space charge, DC breakdown, and DC conductivity tests indicated that the group with bimodal grafting of long and short chain PDMS exhibited better suppression of injected space charge effects, higher DC breakdown field strength, and lower volume conductivity. The reason is that the increase in the effective grafting density of long and short-chain PDMS on the surface of nano-TiO2 particles will result in a denser mesh structure in the interfacial region and reduce the free volume. Additionally, the difference in surface energy between nano TiO2 and SIR is reduced, which can promote the dispersion of nano TiO2 particles in the silicone rubber matrix, enhance the interfacial interaction between silicone rubber and nano TiO2, and thus improve the direct current insulation performance of the nano TiO2/SIR composite material.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",31,2023

Chlorine reacts with natural organic substances in water and causes the formation of disinfection byproducts that might cause health problems. The predominant by-product of chlorination is trihalomethanes. Humic substances, which make up the majority of natural organic substances, are the primary precursors of trihalomethanes. In this study, the effect of different doses of chlorine on the formation of chloroform, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane and bromoform in the presence of natural organic matter and bromide in drinking water was evaluated. Artificial raw water samples prepared with the addition of 2, 3 and 5 mg/L humic acid representing natural organic matter were subjected to chlorination at doses of 1, 2 and 3 mg/L and analysed on the 0th, 3rd and 7th day. The only trihalomethane formed was chloroform with a concentration of 20.52-131.13 μg/L. Increased humic acid and chlorine levels resulted in increased chloroform content. Free chlorine in the water caused chloroform formation to continue even on the 7th day. Accordingly, the amount of chloroform formed increased with the contact time. While the chlorine dose was constant, increased humic acid resulted in decreased free chlorine. To evaluate the effect of bromide on trihalomethane formation, 200 μg/L bromide was added to 2 mg/L humic acid containing water, and 1 mg/L and 2 mg/L chlorination was applied. At the end of the chlorination process in bromide-free waters, only 23.46-41.90 μg/L of chloroform was formed. In the presence of bromide, chloroform, bromodichloromethane, dibromochloromethane and bromoform were formed and the total trihalomethane level increased to 50.03-85.59 μg/L.

All rights reserved.In contemporary substations, intelligent secondary equipment plays a crucial role, with many electrical parameters required for its operation introduced through secondary cables. Secondary cables are mostly located in the switching field, making them susceptible to strong transient electromagnetic disturbances. To investigate the suppression effects and the influencing factors of added magnetic rings on secondary disturbance voltage, a laboratory simulation injection test platform and a substation injection test platform were constructed, with the experimental studies conducted on two different cable scales. Using the injection methods, electrical fast transient burst and damping oscillatory waves were injected separately at the cable initiation end (switching field) through a capacitive coupling as the excitation source. We measured the ground-to-core common-mode voltage at the cable terminal (protective chamber) and explored the influence of factors such as magnetic ring string length, installation position, and materials on the suppression effect. Subsequently, an equivalent circuit model of the test platform was established, and the impact of installation position was analyzed by using the transmission line theory. The research findings indicate that the suppression effect with the magnetic ring string increasing has a rising trend. However, the increase rate of the suppression effect slows down after the magnetic ring string is increased to a certain length; to enhance the suppression effect, the selection of magnetic ring materials should adhere to principles such as appropriate high magnetic permeability, high impedance loss, favorable high-frequency characteristics, and large saturation magnetic flux density; installing magnetic rings at the end of the protection chamber can suppress the disturbance voltage, whereas installing them at the end of the switching field will increase the core wire voltage at the protection chamber end. It is also revealed that the optimal installation position is closely related to the actual cable routing. The research results can be applied to the protection of secondary cable disturbance voltage in substations, enhancing the reliability of secondary equipment and sensitive circuits.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",29,2023

Anthocyanin extract was obtained from waste carnation flowers and turned into powder products via freeze- and spray-drying. Various properties of the powders were analyzed and statistically compared. Since degradation parameters of anthocyanins should be taken into consideration during the planning of the materials to which anthocyanin-based colorant will be added, the kinetic parameters of carnation anthocyanins were calculated at different pH (2.6, 4.0, and 6.0) and temperature (70, 80, and 90°C) values.

Based on the experimental results, a model for the gas switch conduction dispersion and a circuit simulation model with various parameter modules were developed to study how the discharge current varies as the switch conduction dispersion size and different circuit parameters change. The study results show that overcurrent in the loop is caused by switch conduction dispersion. The overcurrent extremes will rise further with decreasing loop inductance and capacitance, raising load inductance, and increasing the number of parallel circuits. Overvoltage is a necessary condition for the switch to be able to turn on after a delay of several microseconds. The circuit’s maximum overcurrent peak value for module 1 is 607 kA at 70 kV operating voltage and has an overcurrent multiplier of 1.33; the maximum overcurrent peak value of circuit for module 2 is 590 kA at 35 kV operating voltage and has an overcurrent multiplier of 15.6. As the number of delayed conduction switches and switch conduction dispersion increases, the peak value of the load current decreases, and the rise time of the load current increases. Moreover, the charge redistribution between each circuit causes the load current to be affected less than the circuit current. The availability of load current and the safe operation of the device allow fluctuations in peak load current of no more than 5%, requiring a dispersion of no more than 587.5 ns for module 1 and 35.25 μs for module 2, corresponding to overcurrent maximum values of 504 kA and 135 kA, respectively.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",25,2023

Therefore, miniature transformers must be designed as the case may be, and the contribution rate of design to product cost performance is as high as 70%. Most transformers are based on feasible design. Optimization design may compromise multi-objective under constraints, whereas, the multi-variable nonlinear equations for the optimization design have neither analytical solutions nor useful numerical solutions easy to find. Consequently, we put forward a visualization algorithm for optimization design. The chromatogram in 3D space corresponds to the value range, and the spatial distribution of multi-objective constraint intersection set is used for interactive optimization. In order to reflect the market price of wire and core, the window rectangle coefficient is proposed as the decision variable. In order to reduce the loss cost, the leakage inductance of non-concentric windings is used to replace the inductor in LC filter. The design data and experimental results are given, and the effect of optimization design is verified by comparing with the data of similar transformers. Combined with the mathematical model, the program code and the generated image are given accordingly, so that the 4D visualization algorithm can be used as a reference for other optimization designs.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",23,2023

All rights reserved.The long-term aging performance of cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) insulation material for high-voltage power cables will determine the operating reliability and working life of cables. This work aims to evaluate the long-term working reliability of the domestic 220 kV XLPE insulation material. An imported 220 kV XLPE cable insulation material was taken as a reference, and the electrical and thermal aging characteristics of domesticaly trial-produced 220 kV cable material were comparatively studied. For the two 220 kV AC cable insulation materials, the long-term thermal-oxidative aging tests were carried out, and the mechanical properties, infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to characterize the thermal-oxidative aging behavior of the materials. Then the constant stress electrical aging tests were carried out using sheet samples. According to the aging life theoretical model, the thermal-oxidative aging and electrical aging lives of the two 220 kV XLPE insulating materials were evaluated. The thermal-oxidative aging test results show that the oxidation rate of domestic trial-produced material is slower, however, its crystallization and mechanical property are relatively inferior. If when the mechanical property is dropped to 30% of the initial value is set as the insulation failure criterion, the thermal-oxidative aging life of imported and domestic materials are 32.85 years and 29.14 years, respectively. The thermal-oxidative aging resistance of domestic trial-produced material is slightly inferior to that of imported material. The constant stress long-term electrical aging test results show that the n indexes of electrical aging life for imported material and domestic trial-produced material are 16.84 and 17.03, respectively. The electrical aging resistance of the domestic trial-produced material is relatively better. The long-term aging performances of domestic 220 kV cable insulation material have reached the level close to that of imported materials.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",16,2023

All rights reserved.Because the classical streamer discharge theory is difficult to explain the rapid breakdown of gas under nanosecond short pulse voltage, the runaway electron breakdown theory is proposed. In order to help understand the theory of runaway electron breakdown, this paper first gives a brief introduction of its development history, and then presents our PIC/MCC simulation results for nanosecond short pulse discharge in atmospheric air. Under negative polarity, with the increase of breakdown voltage, the evolution of runaway electrons from nothing was observed, and sufficient conditions for the generation of runaway electrons were proposed. The pre-ionization channel generated by runaway electron in front of discharge channel head was found and its important role in the rapid breakdown of air gap was indicated. The time required for the channel to cross the air gap under the positive and negative 26 kV breakdown voltage was compared, and the polarity effect reversal of the breakdown voltage was explained. It is found that the highest energy electrons only appear in the strong electric field area at the head of the discharge channel. Even if the electric field there exceeds the critical value, it is difficult for the electrons to enter the continuous acceleration mode. Therefore, the energy of the highest energy electrons is much smaller than that in the negative polarity. Finally, the contribution of high-energy electrons to the rapid breakdown of the air gap is pointed out.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",30,2023

All rights reserved.The erosion of rebound arc during the contact closing process will increase the probability of contact fusion welding and even shorten the service life of the contactor significantly. In order to design a new electrical contact material with good performance and improve the resistance of the contact fusion welding, firstly, we designed three kinds of Cu-W composite contacts with micro-oriented skeleton structures, namely quadrilateral, hexagonal and rhombic dodecahedron. Then, the energy transfer between the arc and the anode was taken into consideration, and a three-dimensional contact pool model was established based on the magnetohydrodynamic model. The contact anode was simulated to be eroded by the thermal action of the arc. The temperature distribution on the contact surface and the pool morphology were calculated, and the welding force was predicted. The results show that, compared with Cu-W composite contacts with disordered skeleton, the contact temperature of Cu-W composite contacts with micro-oriented skeleton structure is lower, the volume of molten pool formed and the contact deformation are smaller, which shows better resistance to arc erosion. The simulation and experimental results indicate that micro-oriented W skeleton structure can improve the electrical and thermal conductivity of contacts, reduce strength, and thus improve the anti-moving welding performance of Cu-W composite contacts.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",31,2023

Under the standard pollution layer, the water contact angle increases from 71.7° to 90.7° after the transfer time of 96 h. The contact angle remains above 100° even after 96 h of immersion in water.

All rights reserved.In recent years, there have been many overheat and discharge faults caused by the failure of the electrical-connection structure (ECS) at home and abroad. In order to explore the seismic response of the Multilam ECS, a finite element model of a ±800 kV converter transformer with the Multilam ECS was established, and the dynamic contact response under the earthquake was analyzed. Based on the numerical calculation model of contact resistance, the three-level failure index of louvers of Multilam contact elements was proposed, and the distribution feature and causes of the high failure-risk louvers were summarized, so as to further reveal the failure mechanism of the ECS under earthquake. The results show that, under normal working conditions, the method that sleeve on the valve side is installed by the inclined cantilever is adopted, thus its own weight will cause the electrical connection structure at the tail to be unable to fully align and the contact fingers of the watch strap to be unevenly compressed, and new contact areas will appear at the end of the connecting male head. Under the influence of earthquakes, the risk of failure of the contact finger blades in the three main positions of the watch strap is highest, and the resistance of the electrical connection structure significantly increases compared to normal working conditions and remains at a high level. The results of the dynamic time history analysis indicate that, there is an undeniable risk of seismic failure in the contact finger type electrical connection structure of the watch strap, and the change in contact force between the contact finger blades caused by the relative motion between the connecting male and female heads is the main reason for its failure. The conclusions can provide basis for the design and selection of the ECS of valve-side bushings and analysis of overheating fault.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",33,2023

At first, an experimental campaign was carried out to evaluate air temperature and air velocity distributions in a naturally ventilated greenhouse with sweet pepper plants cultivated in pots. Then, the main aspects of energy balance, in terms of mass transfer and heat exchange, and both indoor and outdoor climate conditions were combined to set up a computational fluid dynamics model. In the model, in order to simulate the crop presence and its effects, an isotropic porous medium following Darcy’s law was defined based on the physical characteristics of the crops. The results show that the porous medium model could accurately simulate the heat and mass transfer between crops, air, and soil. Moreover, the adoption of this model helps to clarify the mechanism of thermal exchanges between crop and indoor microclimate and allows to assess in more realistic ways the microclimate conditions close to the crops.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",33,2023

Yet their cross-national and longitudinal impact on attitudes toward female politicians and the mechanism through which this process occurs are not well understood. Using multilevel modeling on 87 nations, we examine how different types of quotas, with varied features and levels of strength, shape beliefs about women in politics. We give particular attention to the mechanism of visibility created by quotas in impacting attitudes. Results suggest that unlike quotas with features facilitating low visibility (i.e., weak quotas), those producing high visibility (i.e., robust quotas) significantly impact public approval of women in politics. However, the direction of this effect varies by quota type. Social context also matters. Robust quota effects - both positive and negative - are especially pronounced in democracies but are insignificant in nondemocracies. Limited differences by gender (men versus women) emerge.

This study aims to analyze the process of Islam’s resurgence in the Republic of Kazakhstan, particularly in the context of its independence. The study employs a methodological framework grounded in the historical method of comparison. The findings underscore that Islam has evolved into an integral component of contemporary global civilization. In the era of globalization, it has undergone transformations across various levels of public life, serving as a unifying force for diverse reformist ideologies within the Islamic world. The study’s conclusion highlights the contemporary period in the Republic of Kazakhstan as characterized by a national revival. This revival encompasses the revitalization of national culture and religion, with a strong emphasis on the development of national culture rooted in traditional spiritual values. Additionally, it recognizes the significant role of religion in shaping national identity. However, it is essential to acknowledge the ongoing tension between historically entrenched aspects of Islam and modern trends. This tension underscores the Islamic resurgence as a unifying force driving reformist ideas within the Islamic world. In summary, the Republic of Kazakhstan’s modern era is marked by a profound national revival that encompasses cultural revitalization and a renewed recognition of religion’s role in shaping national identity.

The primary aim of this review work is to give brief insights into the epidemiological aspects of OPA based on a meta-analysis of available research work. This review article also discussed pathogenesis, diagnostic tests and control strategies available for OPA in Sheep. This will help in developing future strategies for disease-free status in India. This disease is endemic in Europe, Africa, Asia, and American continents, causing significant economic losses due to chronic respiratory illness and persistent infections in flocks. The virus is unique among retroviruses with selective affinity to lungs and is the only virus known to cause spontaneous lung tumors in sheep. The incubation time ranges for sheep with naturally occurring OPA ranged from one to four years. There are two pathological forms of the disease: classical and atypical. At an early stage, OPA is difficult to detect in sheep due to a lack of preclinical diagnostic methods, as JSRV is poorly immunogenic and doesn't induce an immune response. PCR, histopathology, and immunohistochemistry are recommended methods for OIE diagnosis. To become a JSRV-free country, mandatory surveillance, detection, and removal of positive animals are required, as OPA is difficult to control due to a lack of vaccines and preclinical diagnostic tests. Due to its similar histological and molecular pathogenesis to that of human lung cancer, OPA is considered an ideal large animal model of human lung adenocarcinoma.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",69,2023

Here we show for the first time that is more than the standard norm (Cotte.2000) which is 18 Calories. Also, after carrying out microbiological analyzes, there is a total absence of pathogenic bacteria, as well as the organoleptic parameters are heading in the right direction where tomatoes irrigated by fish farming water is concentrated compared to the tomatoes irrigated by normal fresh water with Light red of 53 %, Cooked acid of 47 %, spherical form of 94 % and a pleasant smell of 88 %. Therefore, using fish farm effluent in irrigation provides water requirements for plants and also can improve the availability of nutrient elements for tomatoes.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",24,2023

However, its essential oil characterization has been limited to one-dimensional gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. This study identified secondary metabolite composition and variation in M. oleifera seed oil through two-dimensional gas chromatography with time of flight mass spectrometry and their associated bioactivity. GC×GC TOF MS analysis of M. oleifera seed oil was performed on an Agilent 7890 Gas chromatograph equipped with Pegasus 2D GC-TOFMS. About 1µl of the sample (dissolved in n-Hexane) was injected into the system, and the carrier gas was Helium. Identification was made using ChromaTOF software with reference to the NIST library. A total of 2000 phytoconstituents were obtained, of which 236 were identified using the NIST mass spectral values. Total constituents were classified into alkanes (64), alkenes (11), aldehydes (7), alcohol (10), acids (18), acid esters (70), Ketones (10), benzenoids (10), Monoterpenoids (1), olefins (6), Phenols (1), an alkaloid (1), triterpenoid (4), diterpenoid (1), sesquiterpenoid (2), tocopherol (2), and Others (18). Based on area percentage, fatty acids and their derivatives were predominant. The major constituents were Erucic acid (9.10%), trans-13-Octadecenoic acid (6.06%), Triethyl citrate (5.15%), Bis-(3,5,5-trimethylhexyl) phthalate (4.94%). This study reports a detailed metabolic profiling of M. oleifera seeds, which opens up the possibility of identifying and decoding specific bioactivities leading to novel drug discovery in the future.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",33,2023

All rights reserved.Blueberry production is increasing in Brazil, and growers are turning to bio-inputs or biostimulants to be used on their growth. This has been due to the growing concern about sustainability in the food production chain and the necessity to increase the yield. The current experiment aimed at evaluating the effects of Samurai King, EM-1 and Brutal Plus (Minhofértil) biostimulants on the cultivation of Southern Highbush blueberries (V. corymbosum L.), cultivar 'Biloxi'. The parameters evaluated were plant height (cm), diameter of the main stem (mm), number of shoots, chlorophyll content, total number of leaves, leaf length and width. The total mass, number of fruits, average mass per fruit, the transversal and longitudinal diameters, and the total sugars (°Brix) were also measured. In 2020, the treatment of Samurai King + EM-1 showed the highest efficiency for the studied parameters related to fruits and yield but with no significant difference as compared to the other treatments. Regarding the plant growth, treatments 1 (Brutal Plus) and 5 (Brutal Plus + EM-1) were the most efficient. In 2021, treatment 7 (Brutal Plus + Samurai King + EM-1) had the highest yields, except for average mass per fruit and total sugars. In the two years of evaluation, although treatments obtained lower averages than the control, the effect observed was generally positive, revealing the efficiency of products containing microorganisms for the growth of blueberry plants. In conclusion, these bioproducts could remarkably affect plant biomass, production and fruit quality, resulting in better yields.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",34,2023

Results also suggest that in general, younger, less-rooted, and Mandarin-dominant speakers have a narrower formant distance and shorter duration, indicating a less palatallike /l/ pronunciation. The loss of [lj] among these speakers may be linked to a rapidly changing linguistic ecology, which fuels cross-linguistic transfer from Mandarin, the language of communication with outsiders.

All rights reserved.Rooted in medieval juridical thinking, early modern legal culture saw community’s law as the expression of an underlying order of things, something defined not by the willing agreement of the parts that constituted the community, but rather by nature and nurture. For the Iberian world, this belief was expressed in the idea of the ‘señorío natural’, which according to legal doctrine was a bond that linked subjects to the land where they were born and subjected them to a common jurisdiction (Hespanha, Uncommon Laws). Communities and all kinds of corporate bodies thus also had a natural origin, which points to an intertwinement, and not a contradiction, between nature and different kinds of collective bodies. These bodies—corporations, guilds, communities, families, and so on—were the basis for the assignment of rights, obligations, privileges, and duties, but also for the distribution of access to land. This article seeks to reframe ownership and property within this framework as a way of rethinking the ways in which communities defined their relations to land.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",41,2023

The quantification of the amount of a functional ingredient is an important step in food authenticity. The availability of non-destructive techniques for quantitative and qualitative analyses of food is therefore desirable. This research aimed to investigate the feasibility of hyperspectral imaging in reflectance mode for the evaluation of the soy flour content, also to investigate the possibility of implementing a feed-back control system to precisely dose the soy flour during the industrial production of pasta. Samples of pasta in shape of spaghetti were produced with durum wheat semolina and soy flour at increasing percentages (0, to 50%, steps of 5%). A feature selection algorithm was used to predict the amount of soy flour. The most influent wavelengths were selected, and a six-term Gauss function was trained, validated, and tested. The identified transfer function was able to predict the percentage of soy flour with high r accuracy, with an R2adj value of 0.98 and a Root Mean Square Error of 1.31. The developed system could represent a feasible tool to control the process in a continuous mode.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",35,2023

This synchronous study examines the tendencies in contemporary naming patterns. The research material was obtained from the animal records and interviews with Zoo employees. The corpus consists of 140 proper names of animals that represent 13 species. Against the background of the whole Africarium collection (more than 300 species and 4,000 animals), the collected nomenclature material constitutes only a fraction (approx. 0.03%). The research conducted proves however that not only mammals, but also birds and fish get names — the names of these classes of vertebrates constitute more than 80% of the analysed zoonimic corpus. These animals represent a significant part of the Africarium collection, which in turns results from the specific nature of the African biotope. Naming motivation is the core criterion for the categorisation of the items found in the corpus. Three basic sets have been distinguished in the material collected: I. Single-motivation zoonyms, II. Multi-motivation zoonyms and III. Zoonyms with an unclear motivation. Within the first of them further specifications have been introduced. The most productive set is the one including single-motivation zoonyms (91.5%), and within it the class of zoonyms motivated conventionally (46.1%) and motivated externally, referring to circumstances and situations connected with an animal (36.7%). The names of the inhabitants of the Africarium follow certain naming patterns, some of which pertain to the particular species (e.g., members of the Arctocephalus genus receive pragmatically motivated names; the names of the hippopotamuses are based on the names of dances; and the names of Oman cownose rays are based on the names/surnames of fashion designers); other naming patterns are used universally (e.g., matronymic names that begin with the first letter of the mother’s name are given to, i.a., manatees). The majority of the research material contains semantic transformations based on metaphors or metonymies (92.1%), while lexical derivations are fairly rare (7.9%). Repetition and the existence of variants of the names are relatively infrequent within the corpus.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",59,2023

In aged ANKS1A knock-out (KO) brains, vessel lesions exhibiting cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) are observed. In addition, CCM-like lesions show localized peripheral blood leakage into the brain. The CCM-like lesions reveal immune cells infiltrating the parenchyma. The CCM-like lesions also contain significantly fewer astrocyte endfeets and tight junctions, indicating that the integrity of the BBB has been partially compromised. CCM-like lesions display increased fibronectin expression in blood vessels, which is also confirmed in cultured endothelial cells deficient for ANKS1A.

MOR is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a role in reward and analgesic effects. While expression of MOR has been well established in neurons and microglia, astrocytic MOR expression has been less clear. Recently, we have reported that MOR is expressed in hippocampal astrocytes, and its activation has a critical role in the establishment of conditioned place preference. Despite this critical role, the expression and function of astrocytic MOR from other brain regions are still unknown. Here, we report that MOR is significantly expressed in astrocytes and GABAergic neurons from various brain regions including the hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, periaqueductal gray, amygdala, and arcuate nucleus. Using the MOR-mCherry reporter mice and Imaris analysis, we demonstrate that astrocytic MOR expression exceeded 60% in all tested regions. Also, we observed similar MOR expression of GABAergic neurons as shown in the previous distribution studies and it is noteworthy that MOR expression is particularly in parvalbumin (PV)-positive neurons. Furthermore, consistent with the normal MOR function observed in the MOR-mCherry mouse, our study also demonstrates intact MOR functionality in astrocytes through iGluSnFr-mediated glutamate imaging. Finally, we show the sex-difference in the expression pattern of MOR in PV-positive neurons, but not in the GABAergic neurons and astrocytes. Taken together, our findings highlight a substantial astrocytic MOR presence across various brain regions.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",34,2023

Indeed, some human case reports suggest that lesions including the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) which provides major inhibitory inputs to other thalamic nuclei, may induce thalamic pain, a type of neuropathic pain. In support, recent studies demonstrated that activation of GABAergic neurons in the TRN reduces nociceptive responses in mice, reiterating the importance of the TRN in gating nociception. However, whether biochemically distinct neuronal types in the TRN differentially contribute to gating nociception has not been investigated. We, therefore, investigated whether the activity of parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SOM) expressing neurons in the somatosensory TRN differentially modulate nociceptive behaviors using optogenetics and immunostaining techniques. We found that activation of PV neurons in the somatosensory TRN significantly reduced nociceptive behaviors, while activation of SOM neurons in the TRN had no such effect. Also, selective activation of PV neurons, but not SOM neurons, in the TRN activated relatively more PV neurons in the primary somatosensory cortex, which delivers inhibitory effect in the cortex, when measured with cFos and PV double staining. Results of our study suggest that PV neurons in the somatosensory TRN have a stronger influence in regulating nociception and that their activations may provide further inhibition in the somatosensory cortex by activating cortical PV neurons.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",29,2023

The study proposes insight into the similar features of memeplexes and Ukrainian proper names and concentrates on the defining aspects of memetic onyms (onymic memeplexes). An onymic memeplex is seen as any proper name possessing memetic qualities. All memeplexes are highly likely to possess the following key features: rapid spread, expression of social and cultural norms, longevity, adaptability, variability, revealing collective identity and defining cultural heritage.

The reasons for these changes have been established and substantiated, as well as evaluated from the point of view of practical expediency. In particular, the factors that led to the shift of the offcial naming of Ukrainians include the socio-political processes that began in Ukraine in 1991, the desire of speakers to distance themselves from anything in common with Russia, the practical inconvenience of using three-component structures due to their cumbersomeness etc. An attempt has been made to predict the further development of the trend of the use of patronyms in the modern language. It has been suggested that in the future, in connection with Ukraine’s accession to the European Union, the analysed trend will become even more powerful, as a result of which patronyms will acquire the status of intralingual anthroponyms, functioning in a limited communicative space. The material of the study were two- and three-component anthroponymous models of the formal names of persons selected during the period 2015–2022 from two functional styles of Ukrainian language — journalistic and scientifc. With the help of general scientifc methods (induction, deduction, observation, analysis, synthesis, comparison, systematization) and linguistic methods (descriptive, comparative, pragmatic), the typical manifestations of trends in the use of patronyms in the Ukrainian literary language of the 21st century are comprehensively characterized.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",9,2023

A nonsense mutation deleting the C-terminal SOCS box in the RAB40B gene was identified in a family with axonal peripheral neuropathy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2), and pathogenicity of the mutation was assessed in model organisms of zebrafish and Drosophila. Compared to control fish, zebrafish larvae transformed by the human mutant hRAB40B-Y83X showed a defective swimming pattern of stalling with restricted localization and slower motility. We were consistently able to observe reduced labeling of synaptic markers along neuromuscular junctions of the transformed larvae. In addition to the neurodevelopmental phenotypes, compared to normal hRAB40B expression, we further examined ectopic expression of hRAB40B-Y83X in Drosophila to show a progressive decline of locomotion ability. Decreased ability of locomotion by ubiquitous expression of the human mutation was reproduced not with GAL4 drivers for neuron-specific expression but only when a pan-glial GAL4 driver was applied. Using the ectopic expression model of Drosophila, we identified a genetic interaction in which Cul5 down regulation exacerbated the defective motor performance, showing a consistent loss of SOCS box of the pathogenic RAB40B. Taken together, we could assess the possible gain-of-function of the human RAB40B mutation by comparing behavioral phenotypes in animal models; our results suggest that the mutant phenotypes may be associated with CRL5-mediated proteolytic regulation.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",44,2023

The data show that discourse like is already present in the speech of 3- and 4-year-old children and that even very young children employ like to perform distinct pragmatic functions with specifying uses being dominant until age 8;5. The analysis also shows a notable increase in discourse like as children mature, mainly driven by an increase in attention-directing like, the dominant function of discourse like among children older than 8;5. Conditional inference trees show that the use of discourse like by children is affected by a child’s age, the situation type and the frequency of discourse like in caregivers’ input. Children younger than 7;10 use discourse like only rarely in formal contexts as well as in informal contexts if their caregivers do not use discourse like frequently. However, children use discourse like substantially more if they are older than 7;10 or, in informal contexts, when their caregivers use discourse like frequently. The changes in frequency and the functional shifts in the use of like around the ages of 7 to 9 is interpreted to show that peers become more important as linguistic role models when children enter school. The results thus substantiate research which suggests that the pragmatic and social meanings of discourse markers are learned alongside linguistic constraints rather than after the form has been acquired.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",67,2023

The results show that in direction determination, Mandarin participants’ integrated frame of reference is “front-north, back-south, left-west, and right-east.” By contrast, Mongolian participants use two modes of integrated spatial representation: “front-south, back-north, left-east, and right-west” and “front-north, back-south, left-west, and right-east”. This behavior points to influences from the participants’ dominant and non-dominant languages. Mongolian and Mandarin participants showed a north advantage in cardinal direction judgment tasks with a “front-north” response configuration. Whereas Mandarin participants consistently showed a north advantage effect, Mongolian participants showed a south advantage effect in the “front-south” configuration. This suggests that in addition to the long-recognized difference in north-south/east-west axis preference, a north-south axis specification where south was the normative direction instead of north can result from cultural and linguistic influence.

In its support, I evidence the breadth and strength of the involved actors’ ideology, as well as the influence of civil discourse and the spirit of consensus upon the three phases that characterised Basque standardisation: (1) the ideological polarisation that led to consensual failure around 1901; (2) the ideological depolarisation that culminated in the foundation of the Academy of the Basque Language in 1918; and (3) the ideological repolarisation that caused the breakdown of civil discourse during Primo de Rivera’s dictatorship (1923-1930). Its standardisation was closely linked to the promotion of the journal Revista Internacional de Estudios Vascos and the use of scientific-inductive method in modern Bascology.

Drawing on Langacker’s Cognitive Grammar (Langacker 1987, 2004, 2008, 2017) (CG), I argue that the use of a Nung cl-n phrase is only possible when it refers to a unique instance in the current discourse frame of the current discourse space. This explains why cl-n phrases show a definite-like meaning contrast with other types of nominal phrases (NPs) in Nung, as well as why Nung cl-n phrases can be interpreted as either specific or non-specific indefinite. This paper makes two theoretical contributions. Firstly, it shows that the existing theory of numeral classifiers within CG, which is based on the unitization function of numeral classifiers, is not sufficient to account for the meaning contrast between cl-n and other types of NP in Nung. Secondly, given that a referent that exists in the current discourse frame need not exist in the actual world or pre-exist in the discourse, this paper illustrates how a referent can satisfy a presupposition of uniqueness without satisfying a presupposition of existence in the actual world or in the discourse.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",44,2023

There is an evidence of a long-term relationship between corruption and under-five mortality alongside control variables including health expenditure, income growth and rural population, based on cointegration tests. The empirical results confirm that improving corruption control lowers long-term under-five mortality. Furthermore, greater openness to trade and higher spending on public health reduce long-term under-five mortality, while a growing rural population contributes to it.

Asymptomatic Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) nasal carriage in healthcare professionals makes them potential MRSA reservoirs. Since identification and decolonization would promote cross-contamination reduction and curb communal transmission, this study was designed to identify MRSA nasal carriers among dental students and detect staphylococcal super antigenic determinants among them. Methods: Staphylococci isolates (n=52) from dental students(n=42) were investigated in the study. Following initial microbial speciation and antimicrobial susceptibility determination using standard identification methods, the MRSA strains were identified phenotypically using cefoxitin disc (30 µg). Genes encoding the virulence determinants, namely, TSST (test), enterotoxins (sea and seb), and cytotoxin (pvl), were looked for by PCR. Results: Only 15.09% of isolates were identified as Staphylococcus aureus, and all of them (n=8) were scored as MRSA using the cefoxitin disc diffusion method. None of the tested isolates showed the presence of virulence determinants in standard molecular techniques. Conclusion: Lower prevalence of S. aureus, MRSA, coupled with the absence of virulence determinants in the strains, suggests strategies for better surveillance. Tracking virulence-causing genes in nasal carrier S. aureus strains could enhance efforts to prevent infection outbreaks.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",25,2023

However, there are few empirical research papers examining the relationship between brand authenticity and brand value. There are no such studies for the most valuable brands; therefore, the purpose of this research was to determine the relationship between authenticity and perceived value for such brands. The inf luence of selected determinants (brand consistency, continuity, individuality, and credibility) on the authenticity of the most valuable Polish brands was also analysed. The quantitative survey was conducted in the first quarter of 2023 on a sample of 495 respondents. Structural equation modelling using partial least squares (PLS-SEM) was applied to support the conceptual framework and proposed hypotheses. The results indicate that the authenticity of the most valuable Polish brands positively inf luences their perceived value. In addition, the consistency, continuity, individuality, and credibility of these brands positively inf luence their perceived value. The results of this study indicate the importance of the authenticity of the most valuable Polish brands in shaping their perceived value. Brand marketers should make consistent efforts to enhance the authenticity of brands by increasing their credibility, consistency, continuity, and individuality. This is necessary to continuously monitor brand perceptions in terms of fulfilling promises, consistency of actions taken and being trustworthy.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",95,2023

The broader use of combined heat and power, including high-efficiency cogeneration in particular, contributes to saving the primary energy contained in fuel and reducing the carbon footprint calculated in terms of the combined electricity and heat produced. Electricity generation in high-efficiency cogeneration units has found recognition in many European Union countries. These countries have introduced support systems to stimulate the development of these sources. Poland also has significant potential for the development of high-efficiency cogeneration. In Poland, a dedicated law promoting electricity from high-efficiency cogeneration was adopted in 2018. The law was implemented in the second half of 2019. Other schemes were also implemented in Poland, in which high-efficiency cogeneration units may participate for development purposes. The purpose of the all-new regulations is to further develop high-efficiency cogeneration, guaranteeing the possibility of building new sources or activities related to the modernisation or operation of existing sources. The article presents support systems for high-efficiency cogeneration, together with an assessment of their implementation and the impact on the development of these sources.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",27,2023

This is visible both in the way in which the surrounding environment provides the context for the author's observations on the genre and dialogic style of the text, and, furthermore, in the way in which the rural landscape has a symbolic value that connects it directly to the Roman ancestral values ​​and exempla . As such, it can also be read as a counterpart to the cityscape of Athens, which is depicted in De finibus 5, a place linked to theoretical virtue and intellectual exempla .

The research is based on the analysis of data from the Czech Social Science Data Archive from 2022, which includes responses from 579 respondents aged 15+. The results of research conducted using the CHAID method show that younger and older Roman Catholics have different motivations to reduce food waste. Younger believers focus more on moral issues and feel guilty about wasting food, while older believers prioritise economic considerations and worry about the amount of food wasted. In addition, the study shows that Roman Catholic households with lower monthly food expenditures show more compassion for those in need and feel guilty about food waste, while non-religious individuals in households with higher expenditures are more likely to waste food. These conclusions suggest the inf luence of Catholics’ moral and economic values on consumers’ food waste attitudes and behaviour.

The violation of nature, the destruction of which poses a threat to the stability of the societas, is understood – and manipulated – by the political Cicero as an attack on the res publica and, at the same time, as an act of sacrilege and hybris, punished by the divinity protecting the natural order. This contribution aims to revisit the human-nature relationship as deployed in Cicero’s rhetorical-political strategy, studying the ways in which Cicero exploits the motif of violated nature as a means of undermining the moral auctoritas of the adversary.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",52,2023

All rights reserved.This contribution studies poetic citations in Cicero’s philosophical corpus, specifically those in which elements related to the natural environment appear. The analysis focuses on environmental aspects present in select quotations related to the theme of pain, where nature reflects the condition of physical and psychic suffering of the heroes, Philoctetes and Prometheus. The argument takes in verses from Accius’s Philoctetes, quoted in De finibus and Tusculanae disputationes, and Cicero’s translation from Aeschylus’s Prometheus Unbound (fr. 33 Bl.2), quoted in Tusc. 2, 23-25. The environment emerges as a hostile space that embraces the heroes’ cry of pain. At the same time, Cicero conjures a desolate and lonely landscape in his translation of a passage from Homer’s Iliad (6, 201-202 in Tusc. 3, 63; fr. 24 Bl.2), as the setting in which Bellerophon seeks consolation to his pain, condemning himself to silence and voluntary exile. Cicero does the same, after the death of his daughter Tullia (Att. 12, 15), in a literary gesture that brings together philosophy and autobiography through the theme of pain and loneliness.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",68,2023

Thus, prescribing, dispensing, administering, and using medication needs special attention in the current scenario. Objectives: To study the pattern and rationality of antibiotic use in pediatric patients (1 month to 18 years of age) by using the patient records & prescription and to assess parents' awareness of treatment received and antibiotic awareness by using a questionnaire. Materials and Methods: It was a Prospective study performed at Pediatric OPD of Vinayaka Missions Kirupananda Variyar Medical College and Hospital for 6 months wherein a total of 1200 paediatric OPD and IPD patients were included. The patient’s/caretaker’s adequacy of each parameter was given a Score of 1 and a Score of 0 for inadequacy. Based on these seven parameters, each patient was given a Score of a minimum of 0 to a maximum of 7. Results: The patients included Neonates (6%), infants (8%), children (56%) and adolescents (30%). Results showed that 58% of male patients were majorly affected than female pediatric individuals (42%). The use of antibiotics was observed only in 14 out of 1200 prescriptions. Among the antibiotics, cefotaxime was the most frequently prescribed medication. As per the sum of scores obtained by the patients, 492 (42%) of 1200 patients understood their drug use parameters moderately, followed by well-understood 408 (34%) and poorly understood 300 (24%). Conclusion: This study highlights the rational use of antibiotics among patients and healthcare professionals, thus paving the way to minimize antibiotic resistance.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",13,2023

All rights reserved.The stable operation of power equipment is an important prerequisite for ensuring production and life. The defect size of insulator on transmission line is small. The traditional target detection algorithm is usually difficult to identify the defect target, and the false detection and missed detection rate are high. Therefore, an insulator defect detection algorithm based on Flexible YOLOv7 is proposed to solve the problems of small target, occlusion and complex background in defect detection of insulators with different materials. The algorithm inherits the E-ELAN structure, Rep re-parameterization and auxiliary training strategy of YOLOv7 network, and integrates the GAM attention mechanism in the process of feature extraction to enlarge the significant cross-dimensional acceptance region. The efficient Ghost SPPCSPC structure reduces the parameter redundancy in the model training process, and introduces Efficient IOU Loss to focus on the high-quality anchor box to improve the detection accuracy of the model. Finally, the insulator defects are graded and finely calculated by image post-processing technology, and an insulator defect fault detection system is developed for early warning of faults in combination with algorithm deployment. The experimental results show that the AP, Recall and F1 indexes of the proposed algorithm in the two types of defects of dense target, occlusion and small target detection are all ahead of the current advanced target detection algorithms. The method has certain practical significance in insulator defect detection and fault warning in complex environments.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",22,2023

Materials and methods. The cross- sectional study enrolled 123 patients (62±9 years; 73,2% males) with stable CAD and angiographically ICS (50-90%). Stable angina CCS class II (CCSII) was diagnosed in 70 (56,9%) patients, class III (CCSIII) – 29 (23,6%); 24 (19,5%) patients were free from angina (Afree). Fractional flow reserve (FFR) was assessed in 74 (60,2%) patients (min per patient). The hemodynamically significant lesion was considered if FFR ≤ 0,80 a. u. The decision to perform PCI was undertaken in 93 (76%) patients. In addition, the functional data from 128 lesions were analyzed. Results. The CCSIII group was characterized by less frequent previous PCI (21% vs. 46% in the pooled group [CCSII + Afree]; р=0,018); the predominance of cases with (max) severe [70-90%] coronary stenosis (96% vs. 78% in CCSII and 54% in Afree; ptrend<0,001); the lower (min) FFR ([median, quartiles] 0,70 (0,64-0,74) vs. 0,87 (0,81-0,90) in Afree; p˂0,002); and the decision to perform PCI in the vast majority of cases (93% vs. 79% in CCSII and 46% in Afree; ptrend<0,001). The Afree/CCSII/CCSIIIgroups demonstrated a trend towards a decrease in frequency of cases with (max) [60-69%] stenosis (38%, 13% and none, respectively; ptrend<0,001), and a tendency towards the cases with (max) [80-90%] stenosis to be more prevalent (29%, 39% and 55%, respectively; ptrend=0,051). The frequency of cases with (max) stenosis [70-79%] was comparable in the studied groups (Afree/CCSII/CCSIII: 25%/39%/41%, respectively [ptrend=0,240]). At lesion- level, all [80-90%] lesions (n=28) appeared to be hemodynamically significant. In turn, the [60-69%] lesions (n=24) included 5 (21%) significant ones. Finally, the [70-79%] lesions (n=44) included 28 (64%) significant and 16 (36%) non-significant ones. Conclusions. Among the stable CAD patients with angiographically ICS, those with CCSIII were characterized by less frequent previous PCI, significant decrease in FFR and the decision to perform index PCI in the vast majority of cases. There is a need for more precise diagnosis and assessment of myocardial ischemia in patients with an intermediate pre-test obstructive CAD probability, including the cases of previously performed PCI.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",28,2023

The present study evaluates the herpetofauna diversity and community structure of the Ecuadorian Chocó organic and non-organic agroecosystems by performing diurnal monitoring in linear transects in crops of two high-demand products, plantain and passion fruit. The results indicate that community composition changes due to seasonality and agroecosystem types independently. In the dry season, higher diversity was observed in organic crops than non-organic crops, while in the rainy season more species were observed in the organic and non-organic plantain crops than the passionfruit crops. The most abundant species in both seasons was Holcosus septemlineatus, suggesting that it is highly tolerant to disturbance. Further, niche overlap occurs among species found near the ground and in shady areas, since they compete for resources or establish prey–predator interactions. We conclude that several of the studied species can be used as indicators of environmentally favorable agricultural practices.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",102,2023

All rights reserved.Introduction. To date, despite significant progress in the field of erectile dysfunction (ED) pharmacotherapy, for a certain group of patients, the implantation of a penile prosthesis is the only possible way to return them to an active sexual life. To increase the satisfaction with the sexual life of men and their partners, the improvement of models of penile prostheses, which has its own history, is being carried out. In addition, in andrology, methods of psychotherapeutic correction of ED are introduced for both men and their partners. The aim. To determine the influence of the type of penile implant and psychotherapeutic correction on the frequency of satisfaction of sexual partners. Materials and methods. Out of 354 patients operated on by us, 80 men with severe organic ED and their sexual partners consented to participate in the study. Men underwent penile implantation. Participants were divided into two groups: 1st group – 40 couples in which men had a plastic implant installed; The 2nd group – 40 couples in which men had a hydraulic implant installed. Each group was divided into two subgroups. In subgroups 1a (20 couples) and 2a (20 couples), psychological counseling was given to both partners before and after the operation, in subgroups 1b and 2b no psychological counseling was given. Results: Between subgroups 1b and 2b, patients whose psychological counseling was not performed, differences in the general satisfaction with sexual life in women were not observed, and it was observed in both subgroups in 65% of the patients’ partners. Men of these subgroups were satisfied with their sex life after implantation in 80% and 85%, respectively. In 95% of women after psychotherapeutic support (subgroups 1a and 2a), satisfaction with sexual life was noted, which was statistically significantly higher (Fisher’s exact test, p < 0.05) than in women of subgroups 1b and 2b. In men of subgroups 1a and 2a, this indicator corresponded to 90% and 95%, respectively. Dissatisfaction among partners in subgroups 1b, 2b, respectively, was 35%, among women after psychotherapeutic correction (subgroups 1a, 2a), 10% and 5%, respectively. Conclusions. The obtained data show that satisfaction with sexual life in men does not depend on the implant model and psychological counseling. Unlike men, the frequency of satisfaction with sexual life in female partners after psychotherapeutic correction reaches 95%, which is statistically significant more than without it (р˂0.05).","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2023

Since welding parameters significantly impact the bead quality and weld joint integrity, the main objective was to identify the optimal welding parameters. To achieve this, the input variables including the current (A), voltage (V), and gas flow rate (GFR), and their effects were evaluated for reinforcement (R), width (W), depth of penetration (DOP), and the width of the heat-affected zone (HAZ). For a more efficient and cost-effective investigation, a Box-Behnken design, which is based on response surface methodology, was used for bead-on-plate trials. Mathematical regression models, derived from experimental data, were rigorously validated using the analysis of variance, main effects plots, residual analysis, and the R 2 and Adj. R 2 values. Additionally, the heat transfer search (HTS) algorithm was employed for process optimization. While single-objective optimization provided optimal settings for individual responses, simultaneous optimization aimed to strike a balance between multiple, sometimes conflicting, objectives. This comprehensive approach resulted in specific values, including a reinforcement (R) of 4.285 mm, a width (W) of 9.906 mm, a DOP of 2.039 mm, and an HAZ width of 2.020 mm. These values were achieved with specific input parameters: current (221 A), voltage (24 V), and GFR (21 L·min-1). The Pareto solutions offered a nuanced selection of the most suitable configuration, taking into account the desired values for R, W, DOP, and HAZ. The close alignment between predicted and experimentally measured values for the responses highlights the precision and suitability of the HTS algorithm in estimating critical bead geometries during GMAW of S690QL plates.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",45,2023

This could cause social discrimination, which could be assessed from the perspective of the spatial justice, the avoidance or correction of which would imply public intervention. In this paper, based on the spatial distribution of public bus stops in the city of Santa Fe (Argentina), and of the population (categorized into two levels of vulnerability-deprivation), it is intended to measure the magnitude and significance of social inequalities in spatial access to public transport within the city as a whole and disaggregated in its eight administrative districts. To this end, 300 meters Euclidean distance was established as the optimal range of stops, in accordance with experts’ criteria, and considering walking as travel mode. The spatial coincidences/divergences between degree of proximity and the category of vulnerability-deprivation of the population were analysed using various statistical techniques (association coefficients such as Phi ɸ, Cramer's V, Pearson's contingency coefficient, and Gamma γ), and to establish the possible spatial injustice, the scale-diagram of spatial justice and an inferential test based on the χ² were applied. The results evidenced the existence of vertical spatial inequity in access to the bus network in the city as a whole and that the Northern, coastal and part of the Western border area were the most disadvantaged zones, and at the same time, had a lower degree of accessibility to this service, mainly due to its remoteness to bus stops.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",71,2023

All rights reserved.This article reports on research into the activities of Croatian military-veteran societies in the interwar period (1918-1941) in an endeavour to answer the question as to why in present-day Croatia World War I is at the margins of memory, i.e. why it is a forgotten war. Emphasis is placed on the attitude of the Yugoslav government towards the Croatian military-veteran societies, which gathered together military veterans of the defeated Austro-Hungarian army, and also on the attitude of radical Croatian nationalists toward these societies. Research has shown that the Croatian military-veteran societies were chiefly of a local character, whereas Serbian military-veteran societies took in both the Serbian and the Yugoslav state territory. In further analysis, the conclusion was drawn that the cause of the restricted nature of the Croatian military-veteran societies was Croats at the time not having a nation state that was based on the sacrifice of its sons, and so such societies in Croatia had an exclusively humanitarian character; it was not aimed at reviving the glorious Croatian war record in order to unify the Croatian people. Yugoslavia was primarily a state of Serbs, and it drew on the sacrifices of the war, but only those of Serbian soldiers, and any kind of gathering of the Croats and cherishing of the memory of the defeated Austro-Hungarian army was interpreted as an attack on the foundation of the state. This was why the Croatian military-veteran societies in Yugoslavia between the two wars, which had the potential to outgrow their local character, were either banned or forcibly merged with the dominant Serbian societies. At the same time, radical Croatian nationalists were not particularly interested in such societies. Their programme was not based on any going back to the pre-Yugoslav state, but rather on the establishment of an independent Croatian state; hence, they did not consider World War I, when Croats were fighting for and in favour of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, a significant part of their fight.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2023

The results standout the significant expansion of fruit trees and vegetable crops at the expense of the fragmentation of the pre-existing native vegetation. This fragmentation is characterized by substantial reductions in the area and size of its patches, as well as increases in the separation distance between patches and in the patches’ edge irregularities, with some cases showing confinement to riparian zones.

The spatio-temporal context of maternal death integrated the geographic space as a unit of analysis defined through geographically referenced information or data, making the problem territorialized and visible by virtue of characteristics associated with timely access to maternal health.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",44,2023

Its solutions were supposed to have an effect on the everyday life of citizens, from traffic solutions, the placement of industry, i.e. workplaces, to residential and recreation locations. The urban proposition was discussed within closed circles of the People’s Committee of the city of Zagreb from which information was released to the public and published as part of the public debate. The public debate consisted of signed and unsigned articles reporting and/or commenting on the drafting of the DRO (Directive Regulatory Basis) in 1953 or commenting on/criticizing the content of it. The texts were published in the period from March 1953 until October 1954 in the daily Vjesnik, the weekly Republika, as well as the specialized journals Građevinar and Čovjek i prostor. The expert part of the public discussion refers to the criticism of certain segments of the Directive Regulatory Basis 1953. The engineer Milko Sinković criticized the railway junction, engineer Božidar Vizjak commented on road traffic, whereas the engineers Artur Minichreiter and Elimir Svetličić analysed the proposition relating to the regulation of the Sava River. A general critique of the urban planning proposition of the DRO 1953 was presented by the engineer Peter Sanjanović. The analysis also includes the texts of authors N.M. and M.V. published in the journal Čovjek i prostor, which describe the process of the development of the DRO 1953 and the critique of the proposition.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",23,2023

Nevertheless, the effects of landscape changes on amphibians and reptiles are rarely studied. We set out to determine the effect of landscape attributes at two different scales (landscape and patch) on herpetofaunal diversity in the area influenced by the Reserva de la Biosfera Selva el Ocote, a Protected Natural Area in Chiapas, Mexico. We monitored the herpetofauna from January 2018 to March 2019. We used general linear models to determine the effect of landscape composition and configuration at the two scales. Amphibians were affected by attributes at both scales; their diversity was positively affected by more a permeable matrix and heterogeneous sites at the landscape scale, while being negatively affected by larger patches at the patch scale. In contrast, reptiles were only affected at the patch scale; their diversity was positively affected by greater distances of patches from highways and roads and was negatively affected by greater distances between similar patches and from water bodies. The response of amphibians to attributes at both the landscape and patch scales suggests that their diversity could be favored by habitat, microhabitat, and microclimate conditions contributing to their access to vital resources, decreased risk of desiccation, and decreased exposure to predators. In contrast, for reptiles, connectivity and ease of mobility among patches and access to water bodies at the patch scale appear to be the most relevant requirements to preserve species in the area.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",121,2023

All rights reserved.The initiative to initiate peasant labour cooperatives in the Federal People’s Republic of Yugoslavia was introduced at the Second Plenum of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia which took place from January 29 to 30, 1949. Based on the decisions, the Basic Law on Agricultural Cooperatives was adopted on May 28, 1949. This Law was the legal basis for the accelerated forming of peasant labour cooperatives and the enforced collectivisation of peasantry in accordance with the Soviet model. There are several reasons why the Communist Party of Yugoslavia lost the political will to continue establishing peasant labour cooperatives and supporting their development. Firstly, the peasants worked less on common properties than on their own, secondly, they did not receive any equipment to compensate for the decline of labour productivity; hence, the state had to compensate for the losses of cooperatives from the budget. Furthermore, the tendency of parasitism appeared among peasants. Some of the members of the cooperatives would neglect their work obligations expecting that another member would do the work. The collapse of peasant labour cooperatives started in March 1953 when the government of the Federal People’s Republic of Yugoslavia published the Decree on the reorganization of peasant cooperatives. They were gradually liquidated by the withdrawal of individual peasant farms. The rest of the property was primarily annexed to general agricultural cooperatives. The subject of this article is the liquidation of peasant labour cooperatives in the territory of Karlovac District in 1953. The article was written on the basis of unpublished archival sources and of articles published in the Karlovac Weekly, the newspaper of the Socialist League of Working People of the city of Karlovac. At the beginning of 1953 a total of 18 peasant labour cooperatives were operating in Karlovac District. By September of the same year, 15 of them had been liquidated. Due to a lack of archival records, it was possible to present only the liquidations of four peasant labour cooperatives in this paper: 9 maj from Kašt, Narodni borac from Ladešić Draga, Ozalj and Josip Boljkovac from Vukova Gorica.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",12,2023

At the same time, one should note that the mentioned files observed separately are not always absolutely relevant material. However, as a whole, together with other documentation, they create the prerequisites for a deeper intrusion and a more comprehensive analysis of the topic of observation.

This change took place in Chatino and then diffused to the Southern Zapotec subgroup, contributing to the genetic diversification of the Zapotec languages. Proto-Zapotecan marked irrealis mood with *k- and did not mark realis. *n- indicated continuous aspect and could concatenate with perfective *ku- to render a resultative reading. A continuous-marked positional verb *n-te later grammaticalized as a progressive prefix in Chatino. As both perfective and progressive refer to (at least partially) realized situations, *n- was reanalyzed as a marker of realis mood that could concatenate with aspectual viewpoint prefixes. The realis prefix is shown to be one of several traits diffused from Chatino which contribute to the creation of the Southern Zapotec clade and its divergence from Monte Albán Zapotec.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",96,2023

Our results reveal similar rates of change across clause types, with no evidence for any inherent conservatism of subordinate or main clauses. Our models also support evolutionary biases towards SV, VO, and SO orders, consistent with theories of dependency length minimization that favor verb-medial orders and with theories of a subject preference that favor SO orders.

All rights reserved.This paper analyses the circumstances that affected Croatian emigrants after the collapse of the Croatian Spring, particularly regarding the relations of important figures in Yugoslav society and political affairs with those of the HBZ (Croatian Fraternal Union). The events in Croatia caused by the collapse of the Croatian Spring in December 1971 and the repressive measures applied to the leading figures in them gave rise to a wave of dissatisfaction among emigrants; in particular those who had left for political reasons, who voiced charges that the Croatian people were disenfranchised and oppressed. Although few in number, with their intense propaganda activity and the public expression of anti-Yugoslav and pro-Croatian attitudes, they caught the attention of the international public and also aroused the sympathy of those emigrants who had been building friendly relations with the homeland and its institutions, which caused considerable concern among diplomatic and socio-political representatives in Yugoslavia. A considerable cause for concern was the criticism of the Yugoslav leadership ensuant upon the collapse of the Croatian Spring expressed by John Badovinac, president of the HBZ, which was the most numerous and wealthiest émigré organization and one that had for years maintained good and amicable relations with Yugoslavia, particularly with the MIH (Croatian Heritage Foundation). The concern grew even more because Badovinac used the same arguments as political émigrés. It was feared that political dissidents, after many years of failure to take over the leadership of HBZ, could do so, which would have caused Yugoslavia to lose the support of slightly more than one million emigrants in the United States of America and Canada. Croatian and Yugoslav diplomatic, social and political institutions adopted a joint policy with regards to the HBZ in order to avoid provoking a reaction; it was decided that the Croatian Heritage Foundation send a delegation to the emigrants of the USA and Canada, primarily with the task of maintaining good relations with the HBZ. During the visit, the delegation met up only with pro-Yugoslav oriented emigration organisations; the talks with the HBZ were successful and exceeded expectations, because Badovinac had been influenced by the pro-Yugoslav majority of the main board of the HBZ as well as by the official American policy supporting the Yugoslav leadership. Owing to the successful maintenance of good relations with the HBZ in the Croatian Heritage Foundation, the conclusion was drawn that in general the work with Croatian emigrants, loyal to Yugoslavia, would be successfully continued, regardless of predictions from the beginning of 1971 that had been disappointing to say the least. On the other hand, regardless of the circumstances in the HBZ, the political emigrant community, encouraged by the development of the situation in the homeland for stronger unity and gathering, also continued with its intense activities among the emigrants.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",19,2023

Danas started being published in the second half of February 1982 and half a year later the periodical turned into a huge political issue. The newspaper appeared at a time of a general crisis; with its critical approach, at times even provocative, it frustrated the hardened and obsolete party elite which was determined to defend its hitherto inviolable position. Within a short period of time, the weekly attained a circulation of 120,000 copies, which testifies to its wide appeal as well as to its influence, which in fact distressed the party leadership. With the appearance of Danas, a critical public opinion started to come into being. The party leadership started to deal with the weekly in the summer of 1982 and temporarily discontinued it at the beginning of the following year. This was done by the replacement of the editor-in-chief with a new one, along with young associates who were willing to toe the party line. The result of the changes was a drop in circulation, which literally reduced the weekly to eking out an existence and having only marginal influence. The penalization of Danas was in fact an example of shutting down any public opinion unacceptable to the party leadership, through the principle of democratic centralism and its concrete implementation in practice. It was actually a conflict within the party in which lower-ranking communists lost out.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",13,2023

While scientists hoped for deeper insights into the structure of matter, the public dreamed of a panacea and an inexhaustible source of energy. Therefore, it is interesting to consider what kind of messages the scientific community was sending to the public in those circumstances. The richest Croatian source for such research is the magazine Priroda, a journal for the popularization of science that was published by the Croatian Natural History Society from 1911 until recently. During the first half of the 20th century it was the only continuously open channel of communication between the local scientific community and the public. For the purpose of this research, the content of the journal in the period 1911-1945 was searched and texts relevant to the topic were identified. This article presents the results of the analysis of those texts in a historical context. The retrospective picture of radioactive elements that follows from this analysis is multidimensional and includes the presentation of the results of experimental and theoretical research on the transmutation of elements, the presentation of practical applications of radioactive elements, and the presentation of the dangers that come with the use of radioactive elements. The analysis shows that Priroda gave a complete and balanced glimpse into radioactive elements and their potential, mostly correct and as current and complete as can be expected from a popular magazine.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",22,2023

The authors build on their previous quantitativelinguistic research on Bezruč, which focused on anthroponyms (“Géro versus Ondra. Anthroponyms in Silesian Songs as Seen through the Prism of Keywords and Collocations”), and thus present a comprehensive picture of proper names in this poetry collection. The aim of the study is to use quantitative methods — frequency and collocation analyses and keyword detection — in order to clarify the functioning of place names in “Silesian Songs”, to classify their interrelationships, and to compare them with the system of Bezruč’s anthroponyms. Analyses show that proper names make up 30% of the keywords of “Silesian Songs”, they are thus an important feature of the poet’s poetics. Anthroponyms and toponyms are equally frequent. The distribution of geographical names corresponds to the Zipf distribution — Bezruč prefers a narrow range of names, while many others are only used occasionally. Furthermore, most toponyms are oriented towards Silesia, but there are also localities associated with the Habsburg monarchy, Antiquity, and exoticism, which usually serve as building blocks of metaphors. In the context of Silesia, Bezruč places his poems primarily in the Těšín region; the Opava and Hlučín ones are in most cases the settings of his intimatelytuned poems. Other important traits of the collection are the tension between the names of inhabited and natural places and the multifaceted lyrical subject, which links, via collocations, the four most frequent geographical names of the text — Těšín, Beskydy, Ostravice, and Dombrová.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",15,2023

This paper attempts to comprehend the beam dynamics of charged particles by considering the conservation of canonical angular momentum, which can take on positive, negative, and zero values. The analytical expression to generate a parallel beam using a solenoid is derived. The effect of the final beam size on the values of a solenoid’s spherical aberration coefficient and the position of the minimum beam size with respect to the focal length is studied using electron trajectories. A practical procedure to tune the above two parameters of a solenoid is demonstrated by simply modifying the demountable disks connected at each end. A mathematical model is proposed to accurately determine the axis of a solenoid and the magnetic centre using the measured magnetic field data, which is validated experimentally. Several solenoids, used in the 9.5 MeV 10 kW electron LINAC suitable for sterilizing medical products and food irradiation, have been characterised using this procedure.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",28,2024

The resulting heterogeneous distribution of ventilation increases the risk for ventilation induced lung injury. Clinical measurement of EELV however, remains difficult. Objective: Validation of a novel continuous capnodynamic method based on expired carbon dioxide (CO2) kinetics for measuring EELV in mechanically ventilated critically-ill patients. Methods: Prospective study of mechanically ventilated patients scheduled for a diagnostic computed tomography exploration. Comparisons were made between absolute and corrected EELVCO2 values, the latter accounting for the amount of CO2 dissolved in lung tissue, with the reference EELV measured by computed tomography (EELVCT). Uncorrected and corrected EELVCO2 was compared with total CT volume (density compartments between − 1000 and 0 Hounsfield units (HU) and functional CT volume, including density compartments of − 1000 to − 200HU eliminating regions of increased shunt. We used comparative statistics including correlations and measurement of accuracy and precision by the Bland Altman method. Measurements and main results: Of the 46 patients included in the final analysis, 25 had a diagnosis of ARDS (24 of which COVID-19). Both EELVCT and EELVCO2 were significantly reduced (39 and 40% respectively) when compared with theoretical values of functional residual capacity (p < 0.0001). Uncorrected EELVCO2 tended to overestimate EELVCT with a correlation r2 0.58; Bias − 285 and limits of agreement (LoA) (+ 513 to − 1083; 95% CI) ml. Agreement improved for the corrected EELVCO2 to a Bias of − 23 and LoA of (+ 763 to − 716; 95% CI) ml. The best agreement of the method was obtained by comparison of corrected EELVCO2 with functional EELVCT with a r2 of 0.59; Bias − 2.75 (+ 755 to − 761; 95% CI) ml. We did not observe major differences in the performance of the method between ARDS (most of them COVID related) and non-ARDS patients. Conclusion: In this first validation in critically ill patients, the capnodynamic method provided good estimates of both total and functional EELV. Bias improved after correcting EELVCO2 for extra-alveolar CO2 content when compared with CT estimated volume. If confirmed in further validations EELVCO2 may become an attractive monitoring option for continuously monitor EELV in critically ill mechanically ventilated patients.

Even though risky sexual behavior is a devastating problem in low- and middle-income countries, studies on risky sexual behavior and associated factors among reproductive-age women in Eastern African countries are limited. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the magnitude of risky sexual behavior and associated factors among reproductive-age women in Eastern African countries that help to target high-risk groups and set appropriate intervention. Method: The appended and recent Demographic and Health Survey dataset of 10 Eastern African countries from 2012 to 2022 was used for data analysis. A total of 111,895 participants were included in this study as a weighted sample. Associated factors were determined using a multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model. Significant factors in the multilevel mixed-effect logistic regression model were declared significant at p-values < 0.05. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and confidence interval (CI) were used to interpret the results. Result: The overall magnitude of risky sexual behavior among reproductive-age women in Eastern African countries was 28.16% (95% CI 27.90%, 28.43%), which ranged from 3.80% in Ethiopia to 67.13% in Kenya. In the multivariable analysis, being a younger woman, being an educated woman, being tested for human immunodeficiency virus, having work, drinking alcohol, and being an urban dweller were factors that were significantly associated with higher odds of risky sexual behavior. Conclusion: The overall magnitude of risky sexual behavior among reproductive-age women in Eastern African countries was high. Individual-level (being a younger woman, being an educated woman, being tested for human immunodeficiency virus, having work, and drinking alcohol) and community-level (being an urban dweller) variables were associated with higher odds of risky sexual behavior. Therefore, policymakers and other stakeholders should give special consideration to urban dwellers, educated, worker and younger women. Better to improve the healthy behavior of women by minimizing alcohol consumption and strengthening HIV testing and counseling services to reduce the magnitude of risky sexual behavior.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",27,2024

Using data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), we examined whether plasma biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology (amyloid-β [Aβ42/40], phosphorylated tau [pTau-181]), astrogliosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), and neuronal injury (neurofilament light chain [NfL]) were associated with longitudinal brain volume loss and cognitive decline. Additionally, we determined whether sex, APOEε4 status, and plasma amyloid-β status modified these associations. Methods: Plasma biomarkers were measured using Quanterix SIMOA assays. Regional brain volumes were measured by 3T MRI, and a battery of neuropsychological tests assessed five cognitive domains. Linear mixed effects models adjusted for demographic factors, kidney function, and intracranial volume (MRI analyses) were completed to relate baseline plasma biomarkers to baseline and longitudinal brain volume and cognitive performance. Results: Brain volume analyses included 622 participants (mean age ± SD: 70.9 ± 10.2) with an average of 3.3 MRI scans over 4.7 years. Cognitive performance analyses included 674 participants (mean age ± SD: 71.2 ± 10.0) with an average of 3.9 cognitive assessments over 5.7 years. Higher baseline pTau-181 was associated with steeper declines in total gray matter volume and steeper regional declines in several medial temporal regions, whereas higher baseline GFAP was associated with greater longitudinal increases in ventricular volume. Baseline Aβ42/40 and NfL levels were not associated with changes in brain volume. Lower baseline Aβ42/40 (higher Aβ burden) was associated with a faster decline in verbal memory and visuospatial performance, whereas higher baseline GFAP was associated with a faster decline in verbal fluency. Results were generally consistent across sex and APOEε4 status. However, the associations of higher pTau-181 with increasing ventricular volume and memory declines were significantly stronger among individuals with higher Aβ burden, as was the association of higher GFAP with memory decline. Conclusions: Among cognitively unimpaired older adults, plasma biomarkers of AD pathology (pTau-181) and astrogliosis (GFAP), but not neuronal injury (NfL), serve as markers of future brain atrophy and cognitive decline.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",62,2024

Individuals diagnosed with XLA are at an increased risk of developing autoimmune diseases. However, renal involvement are rare in cases of XLA. Case presentation: In this report, we discussed a specific case involving a 6-year-old boy with XLA who experienced recurrent upper respiratory tract infections since the age of one. He presented with symptoms of hematuria and proteinuria, and renal pathology confirmed the presence of immunoglobulin (Ig) A nephropathy. Treatment comprised glucocorticoids, mycophenolate mofetil, and intermittent intravenous immunoglobulin replacement therapy. Consequently, there was a remission of proteinuria and a partial improvement in hematuria. Conclusions: In this study, we describe the first case of IgA nephropathy associated with XLA. This is an interesting phenotype found in XLA, and it provides valuable insights into the process of autoimmunity and the regulation of immune function in individuals with XLA. Based on our findings, we recommend the evaluation of immunoglobulin levels in patients diagnosed with IgA nephropathy.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",22,2024

Methods: All patients with BPPV were assigned to the migraine group (MG, n = 64) and without migraine group (BPPV w/o MG, n = 64) and completed the Vertigo Symptom Scale (VSS), Vertigo Dizziness Imbalance Symptom Scale (VDI-SS), VDI Health-Related Quality of Life Scale (VDI-HRQoLS), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) at the time of BPPV diagnosis (baseline) and on the one-month follow-up. Headache Impact Test-6 and Migraine Disability Assessment Scale were used for an assessment of headache. Motion sickness was evaluated based on the statement of each patient as present or absent. Results: Compared with the BPPV w/o MG, the MG had higher VSS scores at baseline [19.5 (10.7) vs. 11.3 (8.5); p < 0.001] and on one-month follow-up [10.9 (9.3) vs. 2.2 (2.7), p < 0.001]; experienced more severe dizziness and imbalance symptoms based on the VDI-SS at baseline (61.9% vs. 77.3%; p < 0.001) and after one month (78.9% vs. 93.7%, p < 0.001); and more significantly impaired quality of life according to the VDI-HRQoLS at baseline (77.4% vs. 91.8%, p < 0.001) and after one month (86.3% vs. 97.6%, p < 0.001). On the one-month follow-up, the subgroups of patients with moderate and severe scores of the BAI were higher in the MG (39.2%, n = 24) than in the BPPV w/o MG (21.8%, n = 14) and the number of patients who had normal scores of the BDI was lower in the MG than in the BPPV w/o MG (67.1% vs. 87.5%, p = 0.038). Conclusion: Clinicians are advised to inquire about migraine when evaluating patients with BPPV because it may lead to more intricate and severe clinical presentation. Further studies will be elaborated the genuine nature of the causal relationship between migraine and BPPV.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",50,2024

Anxiety is observed to interfere with gait clinically, but this has been poorly investigated. Our purpose is to utilize gait analysis to uncover the effect of anxiety on gait in patients with PD. Methods: We enrolled 38 and 106 PD patients with and without anxiety, respectively. Gait parameters were quantitively examined and compared between two groups both in single-task (ST) and dual-task (DT) walking tests. Multiple linear regression was applied to evaluate whether anxiety independently contributed to gait impairments. Results: During ST, PD patients with anxiety presented significantly shorter stride length, lower gait velocity, longer stride time and stance time, longer stance phase, smaller toe-off (TO) and heel-strike (HS) angles than those without anxiety. While under DT status, the differences were diminished. Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that anxiety was an independent factor to a serials of gait parameters, particularly ST-TO (B = -2.599, (-4.82, -0.38)), ST-HS (B = -2.532, (-4.71, -0.35)), ST-TO-CV (B = 4.627, (1.71, 7.64)), ST-HS-CV(B = 4.597, (1.66, 7.53)), ST stance phase (B = 1.4, (0.22, 2.58)), and DT stance phase (B = 1.749, (0.56, 2.94)). Conclusion: Our study discovered that anxiety has a significant impact on gait impairments in PD patients, especially exacerbating shuffling steps and prolonging stance phase. These findings highlight the importance of addressing anxiety in PD precision therapy to achieve better treatment outcomes.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",32,2024

Consequently, this study aimed to comprehensively assess the influence of PS and handgrip strength (HGS) on both survival and cardiovascular events (CVE) in patients undergoing MHD. Methods: Data were gathered from patients undergoing MHD at the Hemodialysis Center of Guangzhou Red Cross Hospital in March 2021. We performed a retrospective follow-up spanning 24 months, with death serving as the primary endpoint for observation and CVE as the secondary endpoint. Multifactorial Cox regression analysis, Kaplan–Meier survival curves, trend tests, and restricted cubic spline were applied to explore the association. Results: During a 24-month follow-up, data were collected from 140 patients undergoing MHD with an average age of 66.71 ± 12.61 years. Among them, 52 (37.14%) experienced mortality, whereas 36 (40.00%) had CVE without baseline CVD. Kaplan–Meier survival curves demonstrated better survival rates and reduced CVE risk for patients in the second, third, and fourth quartiles compared with those in the first quartile for PS. Adjusted analyses in different models revealed higher PS levels were independently associated with all-cause mortality (major model, model 4, HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64–0.95) but not with CVE risk (unadjusted HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.77–1.05). Compared with lower quartile PS levels, higher PS levels significantly reduced all-cause mortality (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.10–1.02), and this trend remained consistent (P for trend = 0.021). Finally, the restricted cubic spline method using different models showed a linear relationship between PS and all-cause mortality (P > 0.05), when PS exceeded 4.99 kg, the all-cause mortality of MHD patients significantly decreased. Conclusions: PS was independently associated with all-cause mortality but not with CVE in patients undergoing MHD.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",36,2024

According to the two-way social support theory, social support includes receiving social support and giving social support. However, the effect of the two-way social support on health professional students’ professional identity has not been clarified yet. Methods: To explore the mechanism of how two-way social support affects health professional students’ professional identity, an observational, cross-sectional study was conducted among a convenience and cluster sample of 1449 health professional students from two medical schools in western China. Measures included a short version of the two-way social support scale, a health professional students’ professional identity questionnaire, an achievement motivation scale, and a meaning in life scale. Data were analyzed by use of SPSS26.0 software and PROCESSv4.0 plug-in. Results: Receiving social support, giving social support, achievement motivation, meaning in life, and professional identity were positively correlated with each other. Receiving and giving social support not only directly predicted health professional students’ professional identity, but also indirectly predicted health professional students’ professional identity through the mediating roles of achievement motivation and meaning in life, and the chain mediating roles of achievement motivation and meaning in life, respectively. The effectiveness of predicting health professional students’ professional identity varied among different types of two-way social support, which could be depicted as two-way social support > mainly giving social support > mainly receiving social support > low two-way social support. Conclusion: In the medical education, the awareness and ability of health professional students to receive and give social support should be strengthened. More attention should be drawn on the chain mediating effect of achievement motivation and meaning in life between two-way social support and professional identity. The current results shed new light on exploring effective ways of improving health professional students’ professional identity, which suggested that more attention should be paid to the positive effects of mainly giving social support and two-way social support rather than only on the effects of receiving social support.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",97,2024

However, patients with breast cancer rarely have MSI-High, the use of PEM in such cases in clinical practice is uncertain due to lack of sufficient supporting data. Here, we report the case of a premenopausal woman in who received PEM for MSI-High luminal-type breast cancer. Case presentation: A 40-year-old premenopausal Asian woman was diagnosed with stage IIA (T2N0M0) breast cancer and had an Oncotype DX recurrence score of 38. After surgery, she received 4 courses of chemotherapy with docetaxel and cyclophosphamide. After 3 months of tamoxifen therapy, the patient complained of abdominal pain due to right iliac metastasis, and biopsy of the metastatic lesion showed of luminal type; she was sequentially treated with fulvestrant, a CDK4/6 inhibitor, and an anticancer drug (TS1), but over the next year, metastasis to the bone and para-aortic lymph nodes increased. Tumor was MSI-High; PEM was started, and after three courses, bone metastases were reduced, para-aortic lymph node metastases resolved, opioids were discontinued, and the patient returned to society; PEM was administered for 1 year with no worsening of bone metastases on imaging. Asymptomatic brain metastasis less than 1 cm was detected and gamma knife was performed. Six months after completion of PEM, the patient is working with no new lesions. Conclusion: We report a case of luminal-type breast cancer with bone metastases and MSI-High, which was treated with PEM and showed a rapid therapeutic response.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",9,2024

Alternative splicing of cell adhesion molecules provides additional specificity in forming neuronal connections. For the teneurin family of cell adhesion molecules, alternative splicing of the EGF-repeats and NHL domain controls synaptic protein-protein interactions. Here we present cryo-EM structures of the compact dimeric ectodomain of two teneurin-3 isoforms that harbour the splice insert in the EGF-repeats. This dimer is stabilised by an EGF8-ABD contact between subunits. Cryo-EM reconstructions of all four splice variants, together with SAXS and negative stain EM, reveal compacted dimers for each, with variant-specific dimeric arrangements. This results in specific trans-cellular interactions, as tested in cell clustering and stripe assays. The compact conformations provide a structural basis for teneurin homo- and heterophilic interactions. Altogether, our findings demonstrate how alternative splicing results in rearrangements of the dimeric subunits, influencing neuronal recognition and likely circuit wiring.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",72,2024

The traditional monitoring of the conveyor roller group adopts worker inspection, which has strong subjectivity. Monitoring using sensors necessitates the use of numerous sensors, which can pose wiring challenges. The use of inspection robots for monitoring results can be discontinuous, and their performance may be limited. This study proposes a fault diagnosis method for rollers based on a distributed fiber optic sensing system. By improving the traditional Isolation Forest (IForest), a framework called Incremental Majority Voting Isolation Forest (IMV-IForest) is proposed. By analyzing the optical signal, we extracted the variation patterns of roller faults over time and space, and analyzed the abnormal score distribution between fault data and normal data. Using the dataset collected on-site, we compared and analyzed IMV-IForest with the traditional IForest and the Extended Isolation Forest (E-iForest). The results indicate that the variation of the fault of the faulty roller with time and space can be used for early prediction of roller faults; determine an anomaly score threshold of 0.6; improved IForest have faster computation time and higher accuracy. Finally, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, a 3-month experiment was conducted on a 600 m long belt conveyor in a certain mine, and on-site monitoring results were obtained. By comparing with manual detection results, it was shown that the proposed method has high recognition rate for faulty idlers, with an accuracy rate of 97.92%, and can effectively diagnose faulty idlers.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",24,2024

Therefore, this project aimed to employ nanotechnology to develop a FDC of DPIs for market-leading medicines—fluticasone propionate (FP) and salmeterol xinafoate (SAL)—for asthma management. Nanoaggregates were prepared using a novel biocompatible and biodegradable poly(ester amide) based on the amino acid tyrosine, utilising a one-step interfacial polymerisation process. The produced tyrosine poly (ester amide) drug-loaded nanoparticles were evaluated for content uniformity, PSA, FTIR, TEM, DSC, XRD and aerodynamic performance (in vitro and in vivo). The optimised formulation demonstrated high entrapment efficiency– > 90%. The aerodynamic performance in terms of the emitted dose, fine particle fraction and respirable dose was superior to the carrier-based marketed product. In-vivo studies showed that FP (above the marketed formulation) and SAL reached the lungs of mice in a reproducible manner. These results highlight the superiority of novel FDC FP/SAL nanoparticles prepared via a one-step process, which can be used as a cost-effective and efficient method to alleviate the burden of asthma.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",37,2024

Results: A total of 495 valid questionnaires were collected, and most of the participants were 30–39 years old (68.7%). Average motivation, attitude, and practice scores were 29 [26, 32] (possible range: 8–40), 87 (82, 94) (possible range: 22–110), and 41 (38, 45) (possible range: 11–55), respectively. Correlation analyses showed that the motivation scores were positively correlated with attitude scores (r = 0.498, P < 0.001) and practice scores (r = 0.408, P = 0.001), while attitude scores were positively correlated with practice scores (r = 0.554, P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression showed that intermediate and senior nursing mentors (OR = 0.638, 95% CI: [0.426–0.956], P = 0.030) and different hospitals (OR = 1.627, 95% CI: [1.054–2.511], P = 0.028) were independently associated with motivation. The hospital’s frequency of psychological care was a significant factor associated with nursing mentoring motivation, attitude, and practice. Participation in training (OR = 2.908, 95% CI: [1.430, 5.913], P = 0.003) and lower frequency of job evaluation in hospital (“Often”: OR = 0.416, 95% CI: [0.244–0.709], P = 0.001 and “Sometimes”: OR = 0.346, 95% CI: [0.184–0.650], P = 0.001) were independently associated with practice. Conclusion: Clinical nursing mentors had adequate motivation, positive attitude, and proactive practice towards mentoring and associated factors. Clinical nursing mentorship should be enhanced by prioritizing mentor training, fostering a supportive environment with consistent psychological care, and promoting structured mentorship activities.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",32,2024

Methods: This retrospective analysis evaluates 41 LDD patients treated with PE-PLIF and ULBD from January 2021 to June 2023. A novel ULBD approach, called ‘Non-touch Over-Top’ technique, was utilized in this study. We compared preoperative and postoperative metrics such as demographic data, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score, surgical details, and radiographic changes. Results: The average follow-up duration was 14.41 ± 2.86 months. Notable improvements were observed postoperatively in VAS scores for back and leg pain (from 5.56 ± 0.20 and 6.95 ± 0.24 to 0.20 ± 0.06 and 0.12 ± 0.05), ODI (from 58.68 ± 0.80% to 8.10 ± 0.49%), and JOA scores (from 9.37 ± 0.37 to 25.07 ± 0.38). Radiographic measurements showed significant improvements in lumbar and segmental lordosis angles, disc height, and spinal canal area. A high fusion rate (97.56% at 6 months, 100% at 12 months) and a low cage subsidence rate (2.44%) were noted. Conclusions: PE-PLIF combined with the novel ULBD technique via a large-channel endoscope offers significant short-term benefits for LDD management. The procedure effectively expands spinal canal volume, decompresses nerve structures, improves lumbar alignment, and stabilizes the spine. Notably, it improves patients' quality of life and minimizes complications, highlighting its potential as a promising LDD treatment option.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",32,2024

Brassica rapa) ssp. chinensis] has become popular because of its richness in anthocyanin. However, anthocyanin only accumulates in the upper epidermis of leaves. Further studies are needed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the specific accumulation of it. Results: In this study, we used the laser capture frozen section method (LCM) to divide purple (ZBC) and green (LBC) non-heading Chinese cabbage leaves into upper and lower epidermis parts (Pup represents the purple upper epidermis, Plow represents the purple lower epidermis, Gup represents the green upper epidermis, Glow represents the green lower epidermis). Through transcriptome sequencing, we found that the DIHYDROFLAVONOL 4-REDUCTASE-encoding gene BcDFR, is strongly expressed in Pup but hardly in others (Plow, Gup, Glow). Further, a deletion and insertion in the promoter of BcDFR in LBC were found, which may interfere with BcDFR expression. Subsequent analysis of gene structure and conserved structural domains showed that BcDFR is highly conserved in Brassica species. The predicted protein-protein interaction network of BcDFR suggests that it interacts with almost all functional proteins in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway. Finally, the results of the tobacco transient expression also demonstrated that BcDFR promotes the synthesis and accumulation of anthocyanin. Conclusions: BcDFR is specifically highly expressed on the upper epidermis of purple non-heading Chinese cabbage leaves and regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis and accumulation. Our study provides new insights into the functional analysis and transcriptional regulatory network of anthocyanin-related genes in purple non-heading Chinese cabbage.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",45,2024

Against this backdrop, this study embarks on a comprehensive review of literature concerning the application of exercise interventions in the nursing care of these patients. Such interventions are critical in addressing the debilitating effects of the condition, which include progressive loss of muscle mass and strength, adversely affecting patient mobility, quality of life, and overall survival. This review aims to identify the specific exercise modalities, contents, outcome indicators, and application effects associated with this intervention, in the context of the complex interplay of metabolic, inflammatory, and hormonal factors contributing to muscle wasting in CKD patients. By examining the efficacy of various exercise interventions, this study seeks to elucidate optimal strategies for mitigating the impact of CKD-induced muscle atrophy, thereby informing clinical practices and improving patient outcomes. Methods: According to the method of a scoping review, nine databases (Cochrane, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, ProQuest, Ovid, CNKI, Wanfang Data, and VIP) were searched until September 28, 2023. The included literature was screened, summarized, and analyzed. Results: A total of 20 pieces of literature were included. Some types include aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and aerobic combined resistance exercise. The exercise intensity primarily falls within the mild to moderate range, with a recommended frequency of 2 − 3 times a week, lasting 30 − 60 min each time. The types of outcomes encompassed in this study include body composition, functional testing, strength measurements, laboratory examinations, cardiopulmonary function assessments, and patient-reported outcomes. To varying degrees, exercise intervention positively impacts the subjects' physical activity ability, body composition, and skeletal muscle status. Currently, resistance training is the primary type of intervention used for preventing and treating CKD patients induced by muscle atrophy. Conclusion: Exercise intervention can improve muscle strength, physical function, and quality of life in patients with CKD muscle atrophy. Therefore, patients should be fully informed of the effect of exercise intervention in the treatment of chronic kidney disease-induced muscle atrophy in future, so as to promote the standardized implementation of exercise intervention.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",42,2024

In this study, we compared the diagnostic yield and the clinical significance of FFDM for breast cancer detection in female with dense breasts versus its performance when complemented by automated breast ultrasound (ABUS). Results: This retrospective study was performed during the period between January 2022 and December 2022 including 500 females with dense breast (ACR C&D), who underwent screening using FFDM and ABUS. The images were retrospectively interpreted, and statistical assessments were done comparing the FFDM results alone and after complemented with ABUS. Significance was considered at a p value less than 0.05. The use of FFDM with supplemental ABUS has reduced the numbers of recall and showed improved breast cancer detection with increased positive predictive value (from 74.5 to 83.5%). In comparison, using FFDM alone and associated with ABUS, there was moderate agreement with a kappa test of 0.51; p < 0.001. Conclusion: ABUS can be a useful and powerful diagnostic imaging tool when adjunct to FFDM for screening of dense breast. In this study, ABUS showed less false-negative results and improved the sensitivity of cancer detection.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",35,2024

However, few studies have explored the impact of sense of coherence (SOC) on the relationship between childhood trauma and emotional distress in college students. This study aimed to explore its impact on the relationship between childhood trauma and emotional distress. Analyzing data from 2307 Chinese college students, we found that SOC moderated the association between childhood trauma and anxiety/depression levels. Females showed higher SOC and lower anxiety/depression despite experiencing more childhood trauma. Multiple linear regression revealed that anxiety was negatively associated with SOC(P < 0.001) and grade(P = 0.027), and positively with childhood trauma(P < 0.001) and male gender(P = 0.004). Similarly, the depression exhibited similar associations. SOC moderated negatively the relationship between CTQ and anxiety, as well as between CTQ and depression. Childhood trauma is associated with increased emotional distress risk among college students, but a strong SOC can reduce this risk.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",55,2024

While the plastid genome of this species has been published, its mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) has not been extensively explored, with a notable absence of thorough comparative analyses of its organellar genomes. In our study, we had assembled the entire mitogenome of B. schreberi utilizing the sequencing data derived from both Illumina platform and Oxford Nanopore. The B. schreberi mitogenome mostly exists as six circular DNA molecules, with the largest being 628,257 base pairs (bp) and the smallest 110,220 bp, amounting to 1.49 megabases (Mb). Then we annotated the mitogenome of B. schreberi. The mitogenome encompasses a total of 71 genes: 40 of these are coding proteins genes (PCGs), 28 are genes for transfer RNA (tRNA), and the remaining 3 are genes for ribosomal RNA (rRNA). In the analysis of codon usage, we noted a unique codon preference specific to each amino acid. The most commonly used codons exhibited an average RSCU of 1.36, indicating a noticeable bias in codon selection. In the repeat sequence analysis, a total of 553 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were identified, 1,822 dispersed repeats (comprising 1,015 forward and 807 palindromic repeats), and 608 long terminal repeats (LTRs). Additionally, in the analysis of homologous sequences between organelle genomes, we detected 38 homologous sequences derived from the plastid genome, each exceeding 500 bp, within the B. schreberi mitochondrial genome. Notably, ten tRNA genes (trnC-GCA, trnM-CAU, trnI-CAU, trnQ-UUG, trnN-GUU, trnT-GGU, trnW-CCA, trnA-UGC, trnI-GAU, and trnV-GAC) appear to have been completely transferred from the chloroplast to the mitogenome. Utilizing the Deepred-mt to predict the RNA editing sites in the mitogenome, we have identified 675 high-quality RNA editing sites in the 40 mitochondrial PCGs. In the final stage of our study, we performed an analysis of colinearity and inferred the phylogenetic relationship of B. schreberi with other angiosperms, utilizing the mitochondrial PCGs as a basis. The results showed that the non-coding regions of the B. schreberi mitogenome are characterized by an abundance of repetitive sequences and exogenous sequences, and B. schreberi is more closely related with Euryale ferox.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",73,2024

However, a tumor-promoting effect of BMP4 is reported in other tumor types, especially when SMAD4 is inactive. Methods: To assess the requirement for SMAD4 in BMP4-mediated suppression of metastasis, we knocked down SMAD4 in two different breast tumors and enforced SMAD4 expression in a third line with endogenous SMAD4 deletion. In addition, we assessed the requirement for SMAD4 in tumor cell-specific BMP signalling by expression of a constitutively active BMP receptor. Delineation of genes regulated by BMP4 in the presence or absence of SMAD4 was assessed by RNA sequencing and a BMP4-induced gene, MYO1F was assessed for its role in metastasis. Genes regulated by BMP4 and/or SMAD4 were assessed in a publicly available database of gene expression profiles of breast cancer patients. Results: In the absence of SMAD4, BMP4 promotes primary tumor growth that is accompanied by increased expression of genes associated with DNA replication, cell cycle, and MYC signalling pathways. Despite increased primary tumor growth, BMP4 suppresses metastasis in the absence of tumor cell expression of SMAD4. Consistent with the anti-metastatic activity of BMP4, enforced signalling through the constitutively active receptor in SMAD4 positive tumors that lacked BMP4 expression still suppressed metastasis, but in the absence of SMAD4, the suppression of metastasis was largely prevented. Thus BMP4 is required for suppression of metastasis regardless of tumor SMAD4 status. The BMP4 upregulated gene, MYO1F, was shown to be a potent suppressor of breast cancer metastasis. Gene signature upregulated by BMP4 in the absence of SMAD4 was associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients, whereas gene signature upregulated by BMP4 in the presence of SMAD4 was associated with improved prognosis. Conclusions: BMP4 expression is required for suppression of metastasis regardless of the SMAD4 status of the tumor cells. Since BMP4 is a secreted protein, we conclude that it can act both in an autocrine manner in SMAD4-expressing tumor cells and in a paracrine manner on stromal cells to suppress metastasis. Deletion of SMAD4 from tumor cells does not prevent BMP4 from suppressing metastasis via a paracrine mechanism.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",72,2024

Methods: Retrospective, ethically approved study. DDPM- and GAN-reconstructed single-slice subtraction images of 50 breasts with enhancing lesions were compared to original ones at three dose levels (25%, 10%, 5%) using quantitative measures and radiologic evaluations. Two radiologists stated their preference based on the reconstruction quality and scored the lesion conspicuity as compared to the original, blinded to the model. Fifty lesion-free maximum intensity projections were evaluated for the presence of false-positives. Results were compared between models and dose levels, using generalized linear mixed models. Results: At 5% dose, both radiologists preferred the GAN-generated images, whereas at 25% dose, both radiologists preferred the DDPM-generated images. Median lesion conspicuity scores did not differ between GAN and DDPM at 25% dose (5 versus 5, p = 1.000) and 10% dose (4 versus 4, p = 1.000). At 5% dose, both readers assigned higher conspicuity to the GAN than to the DDPM (3 versus 2, p = 0.007). In the lesion-free examinations, DDPM and GAN showed no differences in the false-positive rate at 5% (15% versus 22%), 10% (10% versus 6%), and 25% (6% versus 4%) (p = 1.000). Conclusions: Both GAN and DDPM yielded promising results in low-dose image reconstruction. However, neither of them showed superior results over the other model for all dose levels and evaluation metrics. Further development is needed to counteract false-positives. Relevance statement: For MRI-based breast cancer screening, reducing the contrast agent dose is desirable. Diffusion probabilistic models and generative adversarial networks were capable of retrospectively enhancing the signal of low-dose images. Hence, they may supplement imaging with reduced doses in the future. Key points: • Deep learning may help recover signal in low-dose contrast-enhanced breast MRI. • Two models (DDPM and GAN) were trained at different dose levels. • Radiologists preferred DDPM at 25%, and GAN images at 5% dose. • Lesion conspicuity between DDPM and GAN was similar, except at 5% dose. • GAN and DDPM yield promising results in low-dose image reconstruction.

Methods: 115 consecutive men with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT prior to prostate biopsy were included for analysis. PSMA intensity, quantified as maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax), minimum apparent diffusion coefficient (ADCmin) and other clinical characteristics were evaluated relative to biopsy concordance using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. A prediction model was developed based on the identified parameters, and a dynamic online diagnostic nomogram was constructed, with its discrimination evaluated through the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and consistency assessed using calibration plots. To assess its clinical applicability, a decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed, while internal validation was conducted using bootstrapping methods. Results: Concordance between mpMRI-TB and CB occurred in 76.5% (88/115) of the patients. Multivariate logistic regression analyses performed that SUVmax (OR= 0.952; 95% CI 0.917–0.988; P= 0.010) and ADCmin (OR= 1.006; 95% CI 1.003–1.010; P= 0.001) were independent risk factors for biopsy concordance.

Myofibroblasts, which originate from interstitial fibroblasts, aggregate in the renal interstitium, leading to significant accumulation of extracellular matrix and impairment of renal function. The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-Abl (encoded by the Abl1 gene) has been implicated in the development of renal fibrosis. However, the precise role of c-Abl in this process and its involvement in fibroblast-myofibroblast transition (FMT) remain poorly understood. Methods: To investigate the effect of c-Abl in FMT during renal fibrosis, we investigated the expression of c-Abl in fibrotic renal tissues of patients with CKD and mouse models. We studied the phenotypic changes in fibroblast or myofibroblast-specific c-Abl conditional knockout mice. We explored the potential targets of c-Abl in NRK-49F fibroblasts. Results: In this study, fibrotic mouse and cell models demonstrated that c-Abl deficiency in fibroblasts mitigated fibrosis by suppressing fibroblast activation, fibroblast-myofibroblast transition, and extracellular matrix deposition. Mechanistically, c-Abl maintains the stability of the RACK1 protein, which serves as a scaffold for proteins such as c-Abl and focal adhesion kinase at focal adhesions, driving fibroblast activation and differentiation during renal fibrosis. Moreover, specifically targeting c-Abl deletion in renal myofibroblasts could prove beneficial in established kidney fibrosis by reducing RACK1 expression and diminishing the extent of fibrosis. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that c-Abl plays a pathogenic role in interstitial fibrosis through the regulation of RACK1 protein stabilization and myofibroblast differentiation, suggesting a promising strategy for the treatment of CKD.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",44,2024

During the three-year strict pandemic control period, the normal process of Environmental Protection Tax Law implementation was impacted, causing alienation and reducing the quality of implementation. This study empirically reveals the alienation mechanism in the implementation of the Environmental Protection Tax Law by taking 1000 Chinese tax professionals, and randomly divides the sample equally into two parts, utilizing 500 samples for the initial test and another 500 samples for the robustness test. This research shows that pollutant emission monitoring (correlation coefficient is 0.07), preferential tax policies (correlation coefficient is 0.03) and the quality of tax personnel (correlation coefficient is 0.06) are not conducive to realizing the crowding-out effect of the Environmental Protection Tax Law, while preferential tax policies (correlation coefficient is 0.05), information-sharing platforms (correlation coefficient is 0.06) and the quality of tax personnel (correlation coefficient is 0.05) hinder the incentive effect, and the remaining elements passed the correlation coefficient test within certain confidence intervals. Therefore, the implementation of China's Environmental Protection Tax Law should be improved in the following ways: the accuracy of the environmental protection departments' supervision of pollutant emissions as well as the scientificity and rationality of preferential tax policies should be improved, the construction of environmental protection tax information-sharing platforms should be strengthened, and compound tax collection and management talent should be created.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",62,2024

Aim: This study aimed to determine the mediating role of self-concept in the relationship between sociocultural and perceived public image of nurses. Methods: This study employed a correlational approach using convenience sampling of 1390 participants. This study was conducted at six large universities in three regions of Saudi Arabia (central, northern, and eastern). Student nurses in their second to fourth years of study were included as participants, with an 89.7% response rate. Data were collected from January to April 2023. Results: A significant positive relationship was observed between sociocultural factors and self-concept (r =.685, p =.0001). In addition, there was a significant positive relationship between self-concept and public image (PI) (r =.352, p value = 0.0001). Furthermore, there was a significant positive relationship between sociocultural and public image (r =.456, p =.0001); sociocultural had a direct effect on self-concept (β = 0.324, SE = 0.098, t = 9.429, p <.0001) and public image (β = 0.605, SE = 0.038, t = 22.617, p <.0001). Furthermore, sociocultural had an indirect effect on public image through self-concept (H6) (β = 0.389, SE = 0.123, t = 12.766, p <.0001). Discussion: The study findings suggest that nursing school programs should take measures to foster a supportive environment that promotes self-concept and public image, while also being mindful of the sociocultural background. This would also open the scope for further research on the matter involving multiple centers. Conclusions: This study suggests the need for programs to boost self-concept and public image that consider sociocultural influences. These ’findings have crucial implications for student nurses’ social and psychological wellbeing as they improve the understanding of how sociocultural affects self-concept and public image.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",50,2024

The best primer pairs designed by SIP gene were screened according to the basic RPA reaction, then the probe was designed. The reaction condition was optimized based on the color development of the LFS detection line. To ascertain the reaction specificity, 10 common clinical pathogens and 10 clinical specimens of GBS were tested. Furthermore, the reaction sensitivity was assessed by utilizing a tenfold gradient dilution of GBS genomic DNA as templates. RPA–LFS method was compared to the qPCR assay and biochemical culture method for the Kappa consistency test. The RPA–LFS technique was able to complete the amplification process within 30 min and the results were observed on lateral flow strips. The method is highly sensitive, with a minimum detection limit of 1.31 ng for GBS. The RPA–LFS method showed consistent accuracy of results compared to qPCR and the culture–biochemical method. The establishment of this method is conducive to the development of on-site immediate detection, which can provide information for the timely development of a reasonable antimicrobial treatment plan, and has a greater potential for clinical application.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",20,2024

Autologous bone marrow stem cell (BMSC) clinical trials for cardiac cell therapy overwhelmingly included male patients. However, meta-analysis data from these trials suggest a better functional outcome in postmenopausal women as compared with aged-matched men. Mechanisms governing sex-specific cardiac reparative activity in BMSCs, with and without the influence of sex hormones, remain unexplored. To discover these mechanisms, Male (M), female (F), and ovariectomized female (OVX) mice-derived EPCs were subjected to a series of molecular and epigenetic analyses followed by in vivo functional assessments of cardiac repair. F-EPCs and OVX EPCs show a lower inflammatory profile and promote enhanced cardiac reparative activity after intra-cardiac injections in a male mouse model of myocardial infarction (MI). Epigenetic sequencing revealed a marked difference in the occupancy of the gene repressive H3K9me3 mark, particularly at transcription start sites of key angiogenic and proinflammatory genes in M-EPCs compared with F-EPCs and OVX-EPCs. Our study unveiled that functional sex differences in EPCs are, in part, mediated by differential epigenetic regulation of the proinflammatory and anti-angiogenic gene CCL3, orchestrated by the control of H3K9me3 by histone methyltransferase, G9a/Ehmt2. Our research highlights the importance of considering the sex of donor cells for progenitor-based tissue repair.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",68,2024

This study aimed to use the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), a well-established serum lipid marker, to investigate the association of dyslipidemia with HL among the general population. Methods: Participants (n = 3267) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey database (2005–2012, 2015–2018) were included in the present study. The AIP was calculated based on the following formula: log10 (triglycerides/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol). HL was defined as a pure-tone average of at least 20 dBHL in the better ear. Weighted multivariable logistic regression, subgroup analysis, generalized additive model, and threshold analysis were adopted to reveal the association between the AIP and HL. Results: In this study of US adults, a positive association was found between the AIP and high-frequency HL. However, the association between the AIP and low-frequency HL was not as strong. In addition, a reverse L-shaped curve with an inflection point located at -0.27 was detected between the AIP and high-frequency HL, followed by a significant positive association after the inflection point. Conclusions: The potential of the AIP as a bioindicator for high-frequency HL is noteworthy, and maintaining an AIP value below a certain threshold might provide beneficial outcomes in the management of high-frequency HL.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",38,2024

However, there is still a need for substantial evidence and mechanistic understanding in many cell types whether both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (SFAs and UFAs) pose a similar effect and, if not, what determines the net effect of fatty acid mixes on glucose metabolism. In the present study, we asked these questions by treating granulosa cells (GCs) with the most abundant non-esterified fatty acid species in bovine follicular fluid. Results revealed that oleic and alpha-linolenic acids (UFAs) significantly increased glucose consumption compared to palmitic and stearic acids (SFAs). A significant increase in lactate production, extracellular acidification rate, and decreased mitochondrial activity indicate glucose channeling through aerobic glycolysis in UFA treated GCs. We show that insulin independent glucose transporter GLUT10 is essential for UFA driven glucose consumption, and the induction of AKT and ERK signaling pathways necessary for GLUT10 expression. To mimic the physiological conditions, we co-treated GCs with mixes of SFAs and UFAs. Interestingly, co-treatments abolished the UFA induced glucose uptake and metabolism by inhibiting AKT and ERK phosphorylation and GLUT10 expression. These data suggest that the net effect of fatty acid induced glucose uptake in GCs is determined by SFAs under physiological conditions.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",60,2024

Methods: The study included 84 patients who underwent uncomplicated phacoemulsification. In Group A, 0.15% sodium hyaluronate drops were added to the postoperative antibiotic/anti-inflammatory treatment. In Group B, only antibiotic/anti-inflammatory treatment was applied. Preoperatively and at 1 week and 1 month postoperatively, all the patients were evaluated in respect of tear break-up time (TBUT), the Schirmer test under anesthesia, the corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) score, mean central corneal thickness (CCT) and mean central corneal epithelial thickness (CCET), and the two groups were compared. Results: A statistically significant difference was determined between the two groups at postoperative 1 month in respect of TBUT, Schirmer test, CFS score, and CCET (p < 0.01). In Group A, a statistically significant increase was determined in the TBUT and Schirmer values at 1 month postoperatively (p < 0.01, p = 0.01, respectively) and in Group B, these values were decreased compared to preoperatively (p < 0.01). The CCET was determined to be significantly thinner in Group B 1 month postoperatively (p < 0.01). A significant increase in CCT was observed in both groups at postoperative 1 week (p < 0.01) and preoperative values were reached at 1 month postoperatively. Conclusion: In the patient group using sodium hyaluronate, significant differences were determined in all dry eye parameters and CCET. The use of hyaluronate sodium drops after cataract surgery was seen to improve dry eye parameters and contribute to a healthy ocular surface by ensuring continuity of the corneal epithelium.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",31,2024

Here, we review the insect fossils from one of the main deposits of this period in the world, Monte San Giorgio, which is considered one of the nine main insect Fossillagerstätten. In this Lagerstätte, located on the border between Switzerland and Italy, a total of 273 fossil insects have been collected in five localities. The fossils found in Val Mara site D, one of the two richest insect fossils sites of Monte San Giorgio, present peculiar features, such as extraordinary sizes and phosphatisation of internal tissues revealing fine internal details. In contrast, the Val Mara site VM 12 fossil record (248 specimens) is dominated by small to medium size insects, usually almost intact, preserving details such as setae on wings and compound eyes. Besides these exceptional features, these fossil insects are of extreme evolutionary importance, since they represent the first or the last occurrence for their lineage. In this regard, their use to calibrate nodes in a phylogenomic dating analysis led to backdating the origin of many insect lineages, including Diptera and Heteroptera.

Here, we examine samples retrieved from the asteroid Ryugu by the Hayabusa2 spacecraft and discover the presence of nonmagnetic framboids through electron holography measurements that can visualize magnetic flux. Magnetite particles, which normally provide a record of the nebular magnetic field, have lost their magnetic properties by reduction via a high-velocity (>5 km s–1) impact of a micrometeoroid with a diameter ranging from 2 to 20 μm after destruction of the parent body of Ryugu. Around these particles, thousands of metallic-iron nanoparticles with a vortex magnetic domain structure, which could have recorded a magnetic field in the impact event, are found.

Here, we compile a global dataset of 167,551 Underwater Vision Profiler 5 Rhizaria images, and apply machine learning models to predict their organic carbon and biogenic silica biomasses in the uppermost 1000 m. We estimate that Rhizaria represent up to 1.7% of mesozooplankton carbon biomass in the top 500 m. Rhizaria biomass, dominated by Phaeodaria, is more than twice as high in the mesopelagic than in the epipelagic layer. Globally, the carbon demand of mesopelagic, flux-feeding Phaeodaria reaches 0.46 Pg C y−1, representing 3.8 to 9.2% of gravitational carbon export. Furthermore, we show that Rhizaria are a unique source of biogenic silica production in the mesopelagic layer, where no other silicifiers are present.

This ‘zombie-like’ state perpetuates harmful effects on tissues and holds potential implications for liver disease progression. Remarkably, senescence exhibits heterogeneity, stemming from two crucial factors: the inducing stressor and the cell type. As such, our present study endeavors to characterize stressor-specific changes in senescence phenotype, its related molecular patterns, and cellular bioenergetics in primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH) and hepatocyte-derived liver organoids (HepOrgs). Methods: PMH, isolated by collagenase-perfused mouse liver (C57B6/J; 18–23 weeks), were cultured overnight in William’s E-medium supplemented with 2% FBS, l-glutamine, and hepatocyte growth supplements. HepOrgs were developed by culturing cells in a 3D matrix for two weeks. The senescence was induced by DNA damage (doxorubicin, cisplatin, and etoposide), oxidative stress (H2O2, and ethanol), and telomere inhibition (BIBR-1532), p53 activation (nutlin-3a), DNA methyl transferase inhibition (5-azacitidine), and metabolism inhibitors (galactosamine and hydroxyurea). SA-β galactosidase activity, immunofluorescence, immunoblotting, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), and cellular bioenergetics were used to assess the senescence phenotype. Results: Each senescence inducer triggers a unique combination of senescence markers in hepatocytes. All senescence inducers, except hydroxyurea and ethanol, increased SA-β galactosidase activity, the most commonly used marker for cellular senescence. Among the SASP factors, CCL2 and IL-10 were consistently upregulated, while Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 exhibited global downregulation across all modes of senescence. Notably, DNA damage response was activated by DNA damage inducers. Cell cycle markers were most significantly reduced by doxorubicin, cisplatin, and galactosamine. Additionally, DNA damage-induced senescence shifted cellular bioenergetics capacity from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation. In HepOrgs exposed to senescence inducers, there was a notable increase in γH2A.X, p53, and p21 levels. Interestingly, while showing a similar trend, SASP gene expression in HepOrgs was significantly higher compared to PMH, demonstrating a several-fold increase. Conclusion: In our study, we demonstrated that each senescence inducer activates a unique combination of senescence markers in PMH. Doxorubicin demonstrated the highest efficacy in inducing senescence, followed by cisplatin and H2O2, with no impact on apoptosis. Each inducer prompted DNA damage response and mitochondrial dysfunction, independent of MAPK/AKT.

The aim of this study was to analyse how digital contacts differ from officebased visits by income as an indicator of socioeconomic status. Specifically, we estimated differences in primary care utilization across income, factors of contribution to these inequalities, and applied a needs-based standardisation of utilization to estimate differences in equity. We used a purposively built consultation level dataset with 726 000 Swedish adult patients diagnosed with an infection, including clinical and sociodemographic variables. Applying concentration indexes (CI) and graphical illustrations we measured how the two types of services are distributed relative to income. We estimated how much of the inequalities were attributed to different sociodemographic factors by decomposing the concentration indexes. Standardised utilization for sex, age and comorbidity allowed for the estimation of horizontal inequity indexes for both types of services. Utilization by the two types of care showed large income inequalities. Office-based visits were propoor (CI -0.116), meaning lowincome patients utilized relatively more of these services, while digital contacts were prorich (CI 0.205). However, within the patient group who had at least one digital contact, the utilization was also propoor (CI -0,101), although these patients had higher incomes on average. The standardised utilization showed a smaller prorich digital utilization (CI 0.143), although large differences remained. Decomposing the concentration indexes showed that education level and being born in Sweden were strong attributes of prorich digital service utilization. The prorich utilization effects of digital primary care may risk undermining the policy goals of access and utilization to services regardless of socioeconomic status. As digital health technologies continue to expand, policy makers need to be aware of the risk.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",53,2024

Due to the low prevalence of pediatric CNS tumors, major advances in targeted therapies have been lagging compared to other adult tumors. We collect single nuclei RNA-seq data from 84,700 nuclei of 35 pediatric CNS tumors and three non-tumoral pediatric brain tissues and characterize tumor heterogeneity and transcriptomic alterations. We distinguish cell subpopulations associated with specific tumor types including radial glial cells in ependymomas and oligodendrocyte precursor cells in astrocytomas. In tumors, we observe pathways important in neural stem cell-like populations, a cell type previously associated with therapy resistance. Lastly, we identify transcriptomic alterations among pediatric CNS tumor types compared to non-tumor tissues, while accounting for cell type effects on gene expression. Our results suggest potential tumor type and cell type-specific targets for pediatric CNS tumor treatment. Here we address current gaps in understanding single nuclei gene expression profiles of previously under-investigated tumor types and enhance current knowledge of gene expression profiles of single cells of various pediatric CNS tumors.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",78,2024

This study investigated the predictive value of pretreatment NLR (pre-NLR) combined with pretreatment PLR (pre-PLR) for the survival and prognosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). A total of 765 patients with non-metastatic NPC from two hospitals were retrospectively analyzed. The pre-NLR-PLR groups were as follows: HRG, high pre-NLR and high pre-PLR. MRG, high pre-NLR and low pre-PLR or low pre-NLR and high pre-PLR. LRG, neither high pre-NLR nor high pre-PLR. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify the cutoff-value and discriminant performance of the model. We compared survival rates and factors affecting the prognosis among different groups. The 5-year overall survival (OS), local regional recurrence-free survival (LRRFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) of NPC patients in HRG were significantly poorer than those in MRG and LRG. The pre-NLR-PLR score was positively correlated with T stage, clinical stage, ECOG, and pathological classification. Multivariate cox regression analysis showed that pre-NLR-PLR scoring system, ECOG, pre-ALB, pre-CRP and pre-LMR were independent risk factors affecting 5-year OS, LRRFS and DMFS. The ROC curve showed that area under the curve (AUC) values of pre-NLR-PLR of 5-year OS, LRRFS and DMFS were higher than those of pre-NLR and pre-PLR. pre-NLR-PLR is an independent risk factor for the prognosis of NPC. The pre-NLR-PLR scoring system can be used as an individualized clinical assessment tool to predict the prognosis of patients with non-metastatic NPC more accurately and easily.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",38,2024

The Plant Phenome Journal published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of American Society of Agronomy and Crop Science Society of America.Plant breeding relies on information gathered from field trials to select promising new crop varieties for release to farmers and to develop genomic prediction models that can enhance the efficiency of genetic improvement in future breeding cycles. However, generating the genetic marker data required to apply genomic prediction at the early stages of a breeding program remains costly for many public-sector breeding programs as well as for many plant breeders operating in developing countries. As the pace of climate change intensifies, the time lag of developing and deploying new crop varieties requires plant breeders to make selection decisions without knowing the future environments those crop varieties will encounter in farmers’ fields. Therefore, both lower cost and higher accuracy methods for prediction of crop performance are essential for creating and maintaining resilient agricultural systems in the latter half of the 21st century. To address this challenge, we conducted linked yield trials of 752 public maize (Zea mays) genotypes in two distinct environments. We developed and trained a phenotypic prediction model to predict yield from manually scored plant traits. The phenotypic prediction approach we employed outperformed genomic prediction in predicting yields in a second environment, with 8.7%–63% higher R2 and 4%–13% less root mean square error than the genomic prediction. The phenotypic prediction has the potential to be applied to a wider range of breeding programs, including those that lack the resources to genotype large populations, such as programs in the developing world, breeding programs for specialty crops, and public sector programs.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",35,2024

While previous studies have shown the safety and efficacy of robotic assistance in laparoscopic general surgery procedures, few studies have evaluated the temporal and regional trends in implementation. In our retrospective population-based study, we aim to evaluate the national trends in robotic surgery. National Inpatient Database (NIS 2009–2014) was used to identify adults who underwent robotic assisted surgery (ICD 9 codes 17.41 to 17.49). Robotic procedures related to seven abdominal organ systems were compared against the trends of Urology, Gynaecologic, and Orthopedic robotic procedures. Discharge weights were applied to calculate National temporal trends separated by hospital size, teaching status and US geographic region. 894,163 patients received a robotic assisted procedure between 2009 and 2014 with 64% increase in utilization. The largest percent change was witnessed in biliary robotic procedures with 2984% change in utilization, followed by hernia (1376%). Lowest percent change was witnessed in esophageal procedures with 114% increase. Medium sized hospitals had the largest change in robotic utilization (41%), with large institutions seeing 18% decrease. Gastric procedures were the most common robotic procedure performed at small institutions (7917 total cases; 316%). Large institutions saw an overall decrease in gastric (− 47%), esophageal (− 17%), small and large intestinal (-16%), and hepatic (− 7%) robotic procedures. Rural non-teaching hospitals saw the largest increase in robotic surgery (274%). Urban non-teaching hospitals saw a decrease of 29%. While urban teaching institutions saw a 20% and 6% increase in gynecological and urological procedures, an overall decrease was seen in esophageal (− 10%), gastric (− 12%), intestinal (− 11%), hepatic (− 17%), biliary (− 10%), pancreatic (− 11%) and hernia procedures (− 14%). Biliary procedures saw the largest increase in rural institutions (740 cases; 392%), followed by hernia (144% increase). South region of the nation had the largest increase in robotic procedures (23%). No change was seen in the use of robotic surgery in the northeast region with the midwest and west seeing an overall decrease (− 4% and − 22%, respectively). Our study highlights the increase in use of robotics for both general and specialty surgery, with an increase in utilization over time. Increased incidence of robotic surgery in smaller, rural institutions with overall decrease in larger, urban teaching hospitals suggests increasing comfort in robotic surgery in the community setting. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the factors associated with increased utilization in smaller institutions.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",6,2024

Vuill. includes many species, some of which are limited to specific regions while others are distributed worldwide. The diversity of Beauveria species is poorly investigated in Syria and most studies lack proper diagnosis of species. Entomopathogenic isolates of this genus were obtained using the Galleria Bait Method. This study aimed to identify these isolates based on morphological characterizations combined with molecular data, using nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1-α) sequences. The diversity of this genus in Syria has also been evaluated using a phylogenetic analysis of available ITS sequences of Syrian isolates in the GenBank. Results: Two entomopathogenic isolates, B195 and B243, were detected in the soil of agro-ecosystems in the Syrian coastal region. Morphological and molecular information revealed that these two isolates belong to Beauveria bassiana (Bals.) Vuill. (Hypocreales: Cordycipitaceae) with 514 bp and 284 bp for the sequences of each isolate for ITS and EF1-α, respectively. Pathogenicity test showed 100% mortality of Galleria mellonella L. larvae 2–3 days post-fungal exposure for both isolates. The phylogenetic tree showed that all Syrian sequences of Beauveria clustered within the species B. bassiana, with a considerable intraspecific diversity, except for two isolates previously identified as B. bassiana, which are closely related to Beuveria pseudobassiana S.A. Rehner and Humber. Conclusions: This study presents a morpho-molecular characterization of two Syrian soil-sourced B. bassiana isolates highly pathogenic to G. mellonella larvae and clarifies their phylogenetic placement. Depending on our findings, further exploration studies of the genus Beauveria in Syria are still needed to better our understanding of the diversity and distribution of this entomopathogen in Syria.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",29,2024

Different parts of plants including seeds could be used to obtain essential (EO) oils from members of the Apiaceae family. In the present study, EOs were components obtained through hydrodistillation from the seeds of anise (Pimpinella anisum), carrot (Daucus carota), celery (Apium graveolens), dill (Anethum graveolens), coriander (Coriandrum sativum), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), and cumin (Cuminum cyminum). EO constituents were determined with Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC–MS) and Gas Chromatography/Flame Ionization Detector (GC-FID) and their antioxidant capacities were determined with the cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH) methods. The antimicrobial activity of EOs were tested against four pathogenic bacteria. Phenylpropanoids in anise (94.87%) and fennel (92.52%), oxygenated monoterpenes in dill (67.59%) and coriander (98.96%), monoterpene hydrocarbons in celery (75.42%), mono- (45.42%) and sesquiterpene- (43.25%) hydrocarbons in carrots, monoterpene hydrocarbon (34.30%) and aromatic hydrocarbons (32.92%) in cumin were the major compounds in the EOs. Anethole in anise and fennel, carotol in carrot, limonene in celery, carvone in dill, linalool in coriander, and cumin aldehyde in cumin were predominant compounds in these EOs. The high hydrocarbon content in cumin EO gave high CUPRAC activity (89.07 µmol Trolox g−1), and the moderate monoterpene hydrocarbon and oxygenated monoterpene content in dill EO resulted in higher DPPH activity (9.86 µmol Trolox g−1). The in vitro antibacterial activity of EOs against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli was evaluated using the agar diffusion method and the minimum bactericidal concentration was determined. Coriander, cumin and dill EOs showed inhibitory effect against all tested strains except P. aeruginosa. While fennel and celery EOs were effective against E. coli and B. cereus strains, respectively, anise and carrot EOs did not show any antibacterial effect against the tested bacteria. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) produced four groups based on EO constituents of seven species. The potential adoption of the cultivated Apiaceae species for EO extraction could be beneficial for the wild species that are endangered by over collection and consumption.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",64,2024

Methods: This was a single-center retrospective cohort analysis. Subjects were stage I-III CRC patients hospitalized in Sichuan Cancer Hospital from January 2017 to May 2021. Patients were divided into abnormal group and normal group according to whether the CK-MB/CK ratio was abnormal after surgery. Through a comparative analysis of clinical data, laboratory test results, and prognosis differences between the two groups, we aimed to uncover the potential relationship between abnormal CK-MB > CK results and CRC patients. To gauge the impact of CK-MB/CK on overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), we employed the multivariable COX regression and LASSO regression analysis. Additionally, Spearman correlation analysis, logistic regression, and receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were conducted to assess the predictive value of the CK-MB/CK ratio for postoperative liver metastasis. Results: Cox regression analysis revealed that the CK-MB/CK ratio was a stable risk factors for OS (HR = 3.82, p < 0.001) and DFS (HR = 2.31, p < 0.001). To distinguish hepatic metastases after surgery, the ROC area under the curve of CK-MB/CK was 0.697 (p < 0.001), and the optimal cut-off value determined by the Youden index was 0.347. Conclusions: Postoperative abnormal CK-MB/CK ratio predicts worse prognosis in CRC patients after radical resection and serves as a useful biomarker for detecting postoperative liver metastasis.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",38,2024

The FA pathway was initially recognized in vertebrates, but was later confirmed in other animals and speculated in fungi. FA proteins FANCM, FANCL and FANCJ are present in Saccharomyces cerevisiae but, their mechanism of interaction to resolve ICL is still unclear. Unlike Dikarya, early diverging fungi (EDF) possess more traits shared with animals. We traced the evolutionary history of the FA pathway across Opisthokonta. We scanned complete proteomes for FA-related homologs to establish their taxonomic distribution and analyzed their phylogenetic trees. We checked transcription profiles of FA genes to test if they respond to environmental conditions and their genomic localizations for potential co-localization. We identified fungal homologs of the activation and ID complexes, 5 out of 8 core proteins, all of the endonucleases, and deubiquitination proteins. All fungi lack FANCC, FANCF and FANCG proteins responsible for post-replication repair and chromosome stability in animals. The observed taxonomic distribution can be attributed to a gradual degradation of the FA pathway from EDF to Dikarya. One of the key differences is that EDF have the ID complex recruiting endonucleases to the site of ICL. Moreover, 21 out of 32 identified FA genes are upregulated in response to different growth conditions. Several FA genes are co-localized in fungal genomes which also could facilitate co-expression. Our results indicate that a minimal FA pathway might still be functional in Mucoromycota with a gradual loss of components in Dikarya ancestors.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",90,2024

The mycoplasma bacterial genus offers a set of relevant properties that make it an interesting chassis for such purposes, the main one being the absence of a cell wall. However, due to their slow growth, they have rarely been considered as a potential platform in this respect.

Ten classes (intervention group) completed 10-min teacher-led HIIT workouts at the beginning of health and physical education (HPE) lessons, and five classes (control group) continued with regular HPE lessons. The mixed methods evaluation was guided by the Framework for Effective Implementation by Durlak and DuPre. Results: Program reach: Ten schools were contacted to successfully recruit three schools, from which 79% of eligible students (n = 308, x¯ age: 13.0 ± 0.6 years, 148 girls) provided consent. Dosage: The average number of HIIT workouts provided was 10 ± 3 and the average number attended by students was 6 ± 2. Fidelity: During HIIT workouts, the percentage of time students spent at ≥ 80% of maximum heart rate (HRmax) was 55% (interquartile range (IQR): 29%—76%). Monitoring of the control group: During lessons, the intervention and control groups spent 32% (IQR: 12%—54%) and 28% (IQR: 13%—46%) of their HPE lesson at ≥ 80% of HRmax, respectively. Responsiveness: On average, students rated their enjoyment of HIIT workouts as 3.3 ± 1.1 (neutral) on a 5-point scale. Quality: Teachers found the HIIT workouts simple to implement but provided insights into the time implications of integrating them into their lessons; elements that helped facilitate their implementation; and their use within the classroom. Differentiation: Making a HIIT involved students and teachers in the co-design of HIIT workouts. Adaption: Workouts were modified due to location and weather, the complexity of exercises, and time constraints. Conclusion: The comprehensive evaluation of Making a HIIT provides important insights into the implementation of school-based HIIT, including encouragings findings for student enjoyment and fidelity and recommendations for improving dosage that should be considered when developing future interventions.

Methods: Two-sample Mendelian randomization (TSMR) was used to investigate the role of PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and NOX (N = 423,796–456,380) in 15 autoimmune diseases (N = 14,890–314,995) using data from large European GWASs including UKB, FINNGEN, IMSGC, and IPSCSG. Multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) was conducted to investigate the direct effect of each air pollutant and the mediating role of common factors, including body mass index (BMI), alcohol consumption, smoking status, and household income. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), two-step MR, and colocalization analyses were performed to explore underlying mechanisms between air pollution and autoimmune diseases. Results: In TSMR, after correction of multiple testing, hypothyroidism was causally associated with higher exposure to NO2 [odds ratio (OR): 1.37, p = 9.08 × 10–4] and NOX [OR: 1.34, p = 2.86 × 10–3], ulcerative colitis (UC) was causally associated with higher exposure to NOX [OR: 2.24, p = 1.23 × 10–2] and PM2.5 [OR: 2.60, p = 5.96 × 10–3], rheumatoid arthritis was causally associated with higher exposure to NOX [OR: 1.72, p = 1.50 × 10–2], systemic lupus erythematosus was causally associated with higher exposure to NOX [OR: 4.92, p = 6.89 × 10–3], celiac disease was causally associated with lower exposure to NOX [OR: 0.14, p = 6.74 × 10–4] and PM2.5 [OR: 0.17, p = 3.18 × 10–3]. The risky effects of PM2.5 on UC remained significant in MVMR analyses after adjusting for other air pollutants. MVMR revealed several common mediators between air pollutants and autoimmune diseases. Transcriptional analysis identified specific gene transcripts and pathways interconnecting air pollutants and autoimmune diseases. Two-step MR revealed that POR, HSPA1B, and BRD2 might mediate from air pollutants to autoimmune diseases. POR pQTL (rs59882870, PPH4=1.00) strongly colocalized with autoimmune diseases. Conclusion: This research underscores the necessity of rigorous air pollutant surveillance within public health studies to curb the prevalence of autoimmune diseases.

Here we report a low-cost DE-CBCT by spectral filtration of a carbon nanotube x-ray source array. The x-ray photons from two focal spots were filtered respectively by a low and a high energy filter. Projection images were collected by alternatively activating the two beams while the source array and detector rotated around the object, and were processed by a one-step materials decomposition and reconstruction method. The performance of the DE-CBCT scanner was evaluated by imaging a water-equivalent plastic phantom with inserts containing known densities of calcium or iodine and an anthropomorphic head phantom with dental implants. A mean energy separation of 15.5 keV was achieved at acceptable dose rates and imaging time. Accurate materials quantification was obtained by materials decomposition. Metal artifacts were reduced in the virtual monoenergetic images synthesized at high energies. The results demonstrated the feasibility of high quality DE-CBCT imaging by spectral filtration without using either an energy sensitive detector or rapid high voltage switching.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",38,2024

However, literature shows clashing results and suggests a methodological source for such discrepancies. We aimed to investigate some of these methodological factors to evaluate the actual role of CGRP as biomarker. Methods: Previous to the experimental part, we performed a literature review of articles measuring CGRP in migraine patients. Using our 399 bio-bank sera samples, we performed a series of experiments to test the validity of different ELISA kits employed, time of sample processing, long-term storage, sampling in rest or after moderate exercise. Analysis of in-house data was performed to analyse average levels of the peptide and the effect of sex and age. Results: Literature review shows the high variability in terms of study design, determination methods, results and conclusions obtained by studies including CGRP determinations in migraine patients. CGRP measurements depends on the method and specific kit employed, also on the isoform detected, showing completely different ranges of concentrations. Alpha-CGRP and beta-CGRP had median with IQR levels of 37.5 (28.2–54.4) and 4.6 (2.4–6.4)pg/mL, respectively. CGRP content is preserved in serum within the 24 first hours when samples are stored at 4°C after clotting and immediate centrifugation. Storages at -80°C of more than 6 months result in a decrease in CGRP levels. Moderate exercise prior to blood extraction does not modulate the concentration of the peptide. Age positively correlates with beta-CGRP content and men have higher alpha-CGRP levels than women. Conclusions: We present valuable information for CGRP measurements in serum. ELISA kit suitability should be tested prior to the experiments. Alpha and beta-CGRP levels should be analysed separately as they can show different behaviours even within the same condition. Samples can be processed in a 24-h window if they have been kept in 4°C and should not be stored for more than 6 months at -80°C before assayed. Patients do not need to rest before the blood extraction unless they have performed a high-endurance exercise. For comparative studies, sex and age should be accounted for as these parameters can impact CGRP concentrations.

Methods: A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the correlation between vitamin D status and KD, as well as the impact of vitamin D status on the progression of KD into CAL. Results: The meta-analysis revealed a consistent and significant association between serum 25(OH)D level and the occurrence KD (studies N = 22; z = -3.51, P < 0.001). Patients with KD had markedly lower levels of vitamin D than healthy controls (SMD: -1.30 ng/mL, 95%CI: -2.05 to -0.55 ng/mL). Conclusion: The study provided evidence supporting a significant association between lower serum vitamin D levels and the occurrence of KD, particularly within the Chinese population. However, the findings did not suggest a direct impact of vitamin D on the development of CAL in KD patients.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",56,2024

A particular complex vocal tic comprises the utterance of swear words, termed coprolalia. Since taboo words are socially inappropriate, they are normally suppressed by people, which implies cognitive control processes. Method: To investigate the control of the unintentional pronunciation of taboo words and the associated processes of conflict monitoring, we used the “Spoonerisms of Laboratory Induced Predisposition” (SLIP) paradigm. Participants read multiple inductor word pairs with the same phonemes, followed by pronouncing a target pair with inverse phonemes. This led to a conflict between two competing speech plans: the correct word pair and the word pair with inverted phonemes. Latter speech error, a spoonerism, could result in a neutral or taboo word. We investigated 19 patients with GTS and 23 typically developed controls (TDC) and measured participants’ electroencephalography (EEG) during the SLIP task. Results: At the behavioral level less taboo than neutral word spoonerisms occurred in both groups without significant differences. Event-related brain potentials (ERP) revealed a difference between taboo and neutral word conditions in the GTS group at the midline electrodes in a time range of 250–400 ms after the speech prompt, which was not found in the TDC group. The extent of this effect depended on the number of inductor word pairs, suggesting an increasing level of cognitive control in the GTS group. Conclusion: The differences between taboo and neutral word conditions in patients with GTS compared to TDC suggest an altered recruitment of cognitive control processes in GTS, likely enlisted to suppress taboo words.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",68,2024

Environmental and geographical conditions exert selective pressure on both geno- and phenotypes of pathogens. Flagellin, directly exposed to external environments and containing important immunogenic epitopes, may display significant variability in response to external conditions. In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of ~ 150 A. hydrophila genomes, leading to the identification of six subunits of the flagellin gene (fla-1 to fla-4, flaA, and flaB). Individual strains harbored different composition of flagellin subunits and copies. The composition of subunits showed distinct patterns depending on environmental sources. Strains from aquatic environments were mainly comprised of fla-1 to fla-4 subunits, while terrestrial strains predominated in groups harboring flaA and flaB subunits. Each flagellin showed varying levels of expression, with flaA and flaB demonstrating significantly higher expression compared to others. One of the chemotaxis pathways that control flagellin movement through a two-component system was significantly upregulated in flaA(+ 1)/flaB(+ 1) group, whereas flaA and flaB showed different transcriptomic expressions. The genes positively correlated with flaA expression were relevant to biofilm formation and bacterial chemotaxis, but flaB showed a negative correlation with the genes in ABC transporters and quorum sensing pathway. However, the expression patterns of fla-2 to fla-4 were identical. This suggests various types of flagellin subunits may have different biological functions. The composition and expression levels of flagellin subunits could provide valuable insights into the adaptation of A. hydrophila and the differences among strains in response to various external environments.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",79,2024

However, which components of the immune response are required during regeneration is unclear. Here, we report positive roles for the antigen presentation-adaptive immunity axis during zebrafish cardiac regeneration. We find that following the initial innate immune response, activated endocardial cells (EdCs), as well as immune cells, start expressing antigen presentation genes. We also observe that T helper cells, a.k.a. Cd4+ T cells, lie in close physical proximity to these antigen-presenting EdCs. We targeted Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class II antigen presentation by generating cd74a; cd74b mutants, which display a defective immune response. In these mutants, Cd4+ T cells and activated EdCs fail to efficiently populate the injured tissue and EdC proliferation is significantly decreased. cd74a; cd74b mutants exhibit additional defects in cardiac regeneration including reduced cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation and proliferation. Notably, Cd74 also becomes activated in neonatal mouse EdCs following cardiac injury. Altogether, these findings point to positive roles for antigen presentation during cardiac regeneration, potentially involving interactions between activated EdCs, classical antigen-presenting cells, and Cd4+ T cells.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",111,2024

Empathetic behavior increases patients’ satisfaction, reduces discomfort, and helps with patient’s satisfaction. Objective: To evaluate the psychometric properties of the Jefferson Empathy Scale and compare the measure of invariance within genders and amongst the public and private sector dental students. Method: This cross-sectional study utilized JSE-HPS version for research purpose. An exploratory factor analysis was performed to detect underlying factors. Reliability of the study tool was evaluated using Cronbach alpha test. Mann Whitney U test was used to compare the differences in scores between genders and among public and private university students while Student’s t analysis compared the scores according to different domains.

For example, face pareidolia, the misperception of illusory faces in objects, could be used to understand how we process real faces. However, it remains unclear whether this illusion emerges from errors in face detection or from slower, cognitive processes. Here, our logic is straightforward; if examples of face pareidolia activate the mechanisms that rapidly detect faces in visual environments, then participants will look at objects more quickly when the objects also contain illusory faces. To test this hypothesis, we sampled continuous eye movements during a fast saccadic choice task—participants were required to select either faces or food items. During this task, pairs of stimuli were positioned close to the initial fixation point or further away, in the periphery. As expected, the participants were faster to look at face targets than food targets. Importantly, we also discovered an advantage for food items with illusory faces but, this advantage was limited to the peripheral condition. These findings are among the first to demonstrate that the face pareidolia illusion persists in the periphery and, thus, it is likely to be a consequence of erroneous face detection.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",58,2024

MMF’s side effects include abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and other gastro-intestinal side effects, which typically appear in the first few months of treatment. However, late-onset diarrhea does not rule out the presence of MMF-induced colitis, which can be misdiagnosed since it is linked to a broad range of histopathological characteristics, including alterations that resemble inflammatory bowel disease, graft-versus-host disease, and ischemia. The differences in treatment response may be explained by the complexity of the histopathologic characteristics. Case presentation: Here we present a case of a 29-year-old Arabian female with lupus nephritis who started on MMF as induction therapy. In two months, the patient was presented to the Emergency Department with diarrhea and manifestations of severe dehydration. Infectious diseases and adverse drug events were suspected, so the patient was admitted for further workup, and MMF was stopped. The patient was diagnosed with MMF-induced colitis based on colonoscopy and histological findings. Fourteen days after stopping MMF, she was within her baseline.

However, the professional attractiveness among long-term care workers has yet to be extensively studied. This study aims to identify the factors that influence the attractiveness of the long-term care profession for nursing home (NH) care workers. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in more than 50 NHs. Perception of professional attractiveness among long-term care workers and potential associated factors were measured using the Attractive Work Questionnaire (AWQ) and structural instruments including the Fraboni Scale of Ageism (FSA) and the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI). A multiple linear regression method was employed to explore the influence of potential independent variables on professional attractiveness. Results: The overall response rate was 99%. The results showed the score of professional attractiveness (185.37 ± 20.034), as well as the scores of each component (99.26 ± 11.258 for work condition, 30.13 ± 3.583 for work content, and 55.99 ± 7.074 for job satisfaction). Findings of multiple linear regression analysis indicated that age(β = 0.129, p<.05), years of work(β = 0.156, p<.05), 12-hour shifts(β = 0.185, p<.05), and training times per year(β = 0.148, p<.05) positively associated with long-term care workers perceived professional attractiveness. Whereas only ageism(β=-0.267, p<.05) significantly and negatively influenced professional attractiveness. Conclusions: The perceived professional attractiveness of long-term care workers in NHs was acceptable. Age, years of work, shifts, training opportunities, and ageism contributed to the professional attractiveness of nursing home care workers in China. Target intervention measures should be taken to enhance the attractiveness of long-term care careers so as to avoid the shortage of long-term care workers.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",52,2024

Offering significant gains in cost, size and complexity, it can also deliver significantly higher signal-to-noise ratios than traditional approaches such as absorption methodologies. In this paper, we present an optical cross-correlation technology constructed around a bespoke customised Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG). Exploiting the remarkable flexibility in design enabled by multiple aperiodic Bragg gratings, optical filters are devised that exactly mimic the absorption features of a target gas species (for this paper, acetylene C2H2) over some waveband of interest. This grating forms the heart of the sensor architecture described here that employs modulated optical cross-correlation for gas detection. An experimental demonstration of this approach is presented, and shown to be capable of differentiating between different concentrations of the C2H2 target gas. Furthermore these measurements are shown to be robust against interloper species, with minimal impact on the detection signal-to-noise arising from the introduction of contaminant gases. This represents is a significant step toward the use of customised FBGs as low-cost, compact, and highly customisable photonic devices for deployment in gas detection.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",29,2024

This paper utilizes micro-data from the Chinese Household Income Project and matching data from 144 cities to investigate the relationship between trade liberalization, urban scale, and urban wage premiums. The results indicate that trade liberalization significantly increases urban wage premiums, which is particularly evident during the early stages of China’s accession to the WTO. However, this effect may fluctuate over time. Surprisingly, in China, the urban scale can increase labor wage income, but it does not magnify the wage premium effect of trade liberalization. Heterogeneity tests based on regions, firms, and income groups suggest that the wage premium effect of trade liberalization is higher in eastern and central region cities than in western region cities, labor wage growth in the service sector is more pronounced than in the industrial sector, and the impact of trade liberalization on wage growth for the middle and lower-income groups is greater than for the high-income group, which helps to narrow income disparities among different groups. These findings are of great policy significance for improving income distribution through labor market liberalization. In this context, they highlight the importance of comprehensive openness and new urbanization in China.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",42,2024

Here we report a new delayed RTP that is postponed by dozens of milliseconds after excitation removal and decays in two steps including an initial increase in intensity followed by subsequent decrease in intensity. The delayed RTP is achieved through introduction of phosphines into carbazole emitters. In contrast to the rapid energy transfer from single-molecular triplet states (T1) to stabilized triplet states (Tn*) of instant RTP systems, phosphine groups insert their intermediate states (TM) between carbazole-originated T1 and Tn* of carbazole-phosphine hybrids. In addition to markedly increasing emission lifetimes by ten folds, since TM → Tn* transition require >30 milliseconds, RTP is thereby postponed by dozens of milliseconds. The emission character of carbazole-phosphine hybrids can be used to reveal information through combining instant and delayed RTP, realizing multi-level time resolution for advanced information, biological and optoelectronic applications.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",49,2024

The limb function was evaluated with the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society 93 (MSTS-93) score, The American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score; the ankle joint ranges of motion as well as the leg length discrepancy were evaluated. Plain radiography and Tomosynthesis-Shimadzu Metal Artefact Reduction Technology (T-SMART) were used to evaluate the position of prosthesis and the osseointegration. Postoperative complications were recorded. Results: The average patients’ age and the follow-up period were respectively 31.5 ± 13.1 years; and 54.8 months (range 26–72). The medium operation time was 2.4 ± 0.5 h; the intraoperative blood loss was 131.7 ± 121.4 ml. The mean MSTS-93 and AOFAS score was 26.8 and 88.5 respectively. The average plantar flexion, dorsiflexion, varus, and valgus were 32.5, 9.2, 10.8, and 5.8 degree respectively. One patient had delayed postoperative wound healing. There was no leg length discrepancy observed in any patient and good osseointegration was observed on the interface between the bone and talus prosthesis in all subjects. Conclusion: The modular structure of the prosthesis developed in this study seems to be convenient for prosthesis implantation and screws distribution. And the combination of solid and porous structure improves the initial stability and promotes bone integration. Therefore, 3D printed custom-made modular talus prosthesis could be an alternative option for talus reconstruction in talus malignant tumor patients.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",43,2024

Most previous research has concentrated on (holistic) spatial representations of faces, often with static faces as stimuli. However, faces are highly dynamic stimuli containing important temporal information. How sensitive humans are regarding temporal information in dynamic faces is not well understood. Studies investigating temporal information in dynamic faces usually focus on the processing of emotional expressions. However, faces also contain relevant temporal information without any strong emotional expression. To investigate cues that modulate human sensitivity to temporal order, we utilized muted dynamic neutral face videos in two experiments. We varied the orientation of the faces (upright and inverted) and the presence/absence of eye blinks as partial dynamic cues. Participants viewed short, muted, monochromic videos of models vocalizing a widely known text (National Anthem). Videos were played either forward (in the correct temporal order) or backward. Participants were asked to determine the direction of the temporal order for each video, and (at the end of the experiment) whether they had understood the speech. We found that face orientation, and the presence/absence of an eye blink affected sensitivity, criterion (bias) and reaction time: Overall, sensitivity was higher for upright compared to inverted faces, and in the condition where an eye blink was present compared to the condition without an eye blink. Reaction times were mostly faster in the conditions with higher sensitivity. A bias to report inverted faces as ‘backward’ observed in Experiment I, where upright and inverted faces were presented randomly interleaved within each block, was absent when presenting upright and inverted faces in different blocks in Experiment II. Language comprehension results revealed that there was higher sensitivity when understanding the speech compared to not understanding the speech in both experiments. Taken together, our results showed higher sensitivity with upright compared to inverted faces, suggesting that the perception of dynamic, task-relevant information was superior with the canonical orientation of the faces. Furthermore, partial information coming from eye blinks, in addition to mouth movements, seemed to play a significant role in dynamic face perception, both when faces were presented upright and inverted. We suggest that studying the perception of facial dynamics beyond emotional expressions will help us to better understand the mechanisms underlying the temporal integration of facial information from different -partial and holistic- sources, and that our results show how different strategies, depending on the available information, are employed by human observers when judging the temporal order of faces.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",58,2024

C. B. Clarke is a traditional Chinese herbal medicine that heavily relies on the lignans found in its dried ripe seeds (Herpetospermum caudigerum), which have antioxidant and hepatoprotective functions. However, little is known regarding the lignan biosynthesis in H. pedunculosum. In this study, we used metabolomic (non-targeted UHPLC-MS/MS) and transcriptome (RNA-Seq) analyses to identify key metabolites and genes (both structural and regulatory) associated with lignan production during the green mature (GM) and yellow mature (YM) stages of H. pedunculosum. Results: The contents of 26 lignan-related metabolites and the expression of 30 genes involved in the lignan pathway differed considerably between the GM and YM stages; most of them were more highly expressed in YM than in GM. UPLC-Q-TOF/MS confirmed that three Herpetospermum-specific lignans (including herpetrione, herpetotriol, and herpetin) were found in YM, but were not detected in GM. In addition, we proposed a lignan biosynthesis pathway for H. pedunculosum based on the fundamental principles of chemistry and biosynthesis. An integrated study of the transcriptome and metabolome identified several transcription factors, including HpGAF1, HpHSFB3, and HpWOX1, that were highly correlated with the metabolism of lignan compounds during seed ripening. Furthermore, functional validation assays revealed that the enzyme 4-Coumarate: CoA ligase (4CL) catalyzes the synthesis of hydroxycinnamate CoA esters. Conclusion: These results will deepen our understanding of seed lignan biosynthesis and establish a theoretical basis for molecular breeding of H. pedunculosum.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",54,2024

During the past few decades, life expectancy of patients has increased significantly owing to advance in medical treatments. Cognitive impairment, once has been neglected, has gradually become more documented. Cognitive impairment in β-thalassaemia patients is associated with natural history of the disease and socioeconomic factors. Herein, to determined effect of β-thalassaemia intrinsic factors, 22-month-old β-thalassaemia mouse was used as a model to assess cognitive impairment and to investigate any aberrant brain pathology in β-thalassaemia. Open field test showed that β-thalassaemia mice had decreased motor function. However, no difference of neuronal degeneration in primary motor cortex, layer 2/3 area was found. Interestingly, impaired learning and memory function accessed by a Morris water maze test was observed and correlated with a reduced number of living pyramidal neurons in hippocampus at the CA3 region in β-thalassaemia mice. Cognitive impairment in β-thalassaemia mice was significantly correlated with several intrinsic β-thalassaemic factors including iron overload, anaemia, damaged red blood cells (RBCs), phosphatidylserine (PS)-exposed RBC large extracellular vesicles (EVs) and PS-exposed medium EVs. This highlights the importance of blood transfusion and iron chelation in β-thalassaemia patients. In addition, to improve patients’ quality of life, assessment of cognitive functions should become part of routine follow-up.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",48,2024

Few studies have looked into the persistence of these changes. In the current study, we investigated to what extent changes in lifestyle and body weight were sustained after two years of restrictions. Methods: We performed two representative online surveys among adults living in Germany. The first survey (S1) was performed in April 2021; the second survey (S2) in June 2022. The questionnaire focused on changes in physical activity, dietary habits, body weight, and mental stress levels. The data were weighted to optimally represent the general population of Germany. Using Chi-square tests, results were compared between the two surveys, and – per survey – between subgroups based on sociodemographic factors and mental stress levels. Furthermore, binomial logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with weight gain. Results: A total of 1,001 (S1) and 1,005 (S2) adults completed the survey, of which 50.4% were men and 49.6% were women in both surveys. Mean body mass index (BMI) at the time of the survey was 27.4 ± 6.0 kg/m2 (S1) and 27.1 ± 5.5 kg/m2 (S2). Reduced physical activity was reported by 52% of the participants in S1 and by 40% in S2 (p <.001). Moderate to severe stress was reported by 71% of the participants in S1 and by 62% in S2 (p <.001). Less healthy eating compared to before the pandemic was reported by 16% of the participants in S1 and by 12% in S2 (p = 0.033). Weight gain was reported by 40% of the participants in S1 and by 35% in S2 (p = 0.059). Weight gain was associated with higher BMI, reduced physical activity levels, less healthy nutrition and increased consumption of energy-dense food. Conclusions: Our results indicate that two years and three months after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the adverse effects on health-related lifestyle factors and body weight still existed, albeit to a lesser degree than directly after the first year of the pandemic. Targeted strategies are needed to better support the population subgroups most likely to change their lifestyle in unfavorable ways when faced with disruptions of their everyday lives.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",29,2024

This study aimed to explore the association between first-trimester fetal size and children’s neurodevelopment and to examine whether intrauterine accelerated growth could compensate for the detrimental effects of first-trimester restricted growth on childhood neurodevelopment. Methods: The participants were from a birth cohort enrolled from March 2014 to March 2019 in Wuhan, China. A total of 2058 fetuses with crown to rump length (CRL) (a proxy of first-trimester fetal size) measurements in the first trimester and neurodevelopmental assessment at age 2 years were included. We measured the first-trimester CRL and defined three fetal growth patterns based on the growth rate of estimated fetal weight from mid to late pregnancy. The neurodevelopment was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development of China Revision at 2 years. Results: Each unit (a Z score) increase of first-trimester CRL was associated with increased scores in mental developmental index (MDI) (adjusted beta estimate = 1.19, (95% CI: 0.42, 1.95), P = 0.03) and psychomotor developmental index (PDI) (adjusted beta estimate = 1.36, (95% CI: 0.46, 2.26), P < 0.01) at age 2 years, respectively. No significant association was observed between fetal growth rate and PDI. For children with restricted first-trimester fetal size (the lowest tertile of first-trimester CRL), those with “intrauterine accelerated growth” pattern (higher growth rates) had significantly higher MDI (adjusted beta estimate = 6.14, (95% CI: 3.80, 8.49), P < 0.001) but indistinguishable PDI compared to those with “intrauterine faltering growth” pattern (lower growth rates). Main limitations of this study included potential misclassification of gestational age due to recall bias of the last menstrual period and residual confounding. Conclusions: The current study suggests that restricted first-trimester fetal size is associated with mental and psychomotor developmental delay in childhood. However, in children with restricted first-trimester fetal size, intrauterine accelerated growth was associated with improved mental development but had little effect on psychomotor development. Additional studies are needed to validate the results in diverse populations.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",36,2024

Growing evidence suggests that stress during this period may interfere with the development of sexual behavior. However, the neural circuits involved in this alteration remain elusive. Here, we demonstrated in mice that pubertal stress permanently disrupted sexual performance without affecting sexual preference. This was associated with a reduced expression and activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) in the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl). Fiber photometry revealed that VMHvl nNOS neurons are strongly responsive to male olfactory cues with this activation being substantially reduced in pubertally stressed females. Finally, treatment with a NO donor partially restored sexual performance in pubertally stressed females. This study provides insights into the involvement of VMHvl nNOS in the processing of olfactory cues important for the expression of female sexual behavior. In addition, exposure to stress during puberty disrupts the integration of male olfactory cues leading to reduced sexual behavior.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",59,2024

Its increased expression is linked to the development and progression of various malignancies. However, understanding of RAB3B’s involvement in carcinogenesis is mostly limited to specific cancer subtypes. Hence, exploring RAB3B's regulatory roles and molecular mechanisms through comprehensive cancer datasets might offer innovative approaches for managing clinical cancer. To examine the potential involvement of RAB3B in the development of cancer, we analyzed data from various sources including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx), cBioPortal, HPA, UALCAN, and tissue microarray (TAM). Using bioinformatics techniques, we examined the correlation between RAB3B expression and prognosis, tumor heterogeneity, methylation modifications, and immune microenvironment across different cancer types. Our findings indicate that elevated RAB3B expression can independently predict prognosis in many tumors and has moderate accuracy for diagnosing most cancers. In most cancer types, we identified RAB3B mutations that showed a significant correlation with tumor mutational burden (TMB), mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity (MATH), and microsatellite instability (MSI). Abnormal DNA methylation patterns were also observed in most cancers compared to normal tissues. Additionally, we found significant correlations between RAB3B expression, immune cell infiltration, and immune scores across various cancers. Through pan-cancer analysis, we observed significant differences in RAB3B expression levels between tumors and normal tissues, making it a potential primary factor for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. The IHC results revealed that the expression of RAB3B in six types of tumors was consistent with the results of the pan-cancer analysis of the database. Furthermore, RAB3B showed potential associations with tumor heterogeneity and immunity. Thus, RAB3B can be utilized as an auxiliary diagnostic marker for early tumor detection and a prognostic biomarker for various tumor types.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",70,2024

However, infant morbidity is largely underestimated. We analyzed the data from a randomized vaccine trial in Bangladesh to identify and assess the effect of risk factors on infant morbidity. Methods: Pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive either inactivated influenza vaccine or pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine and the infants were randomly assigned to receive 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or Hib conjugate vaccine at week 6, 10 and 14. The data were collected from August 2004 through December 2005. Each pair of infant and mother were followed for 24 weeks after birth with weekly visits. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) for repeated measurements and Poisson regression models were used to identify the risk factors and evaluate their effect on the longitudinal incidence and total number of episodes of respiratory illness with fever (RIF), diarrhea disease, ear problem and pneumonia. Results: A total of 340 pregnant women were randomized with mean age of 25 years. The baseline mother and infant characteristics were similar between two treatment groups. Exclusive breastfeeding and higher paternal education level were common factors associated with lower infant morbidity of RIF (adjusted OR = 0.40 and 0.94 with p < 0.01 and p = 0.02, respectively), diarrhea disease (adjusted OR = 0.39 and 0.95 with p < 0.01 and p = 0.04, respectively), and ear problem (adjusted OR = 0.20 and 0.76 with p < 0.01 and p < 0.01, respectively).

This study investigates whether NSUN2 participates in Dox-induced liver injury and the associated molecular mechanism. Methods: In vivo and in vitro liver cell injury models were constructed based on Dox therapy. The protein levels of NSUN2 and oxidative stress indicators Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO1 were evaluated by Western blot. The RNA binding potential was detected by RNA methylation immunoprecipitation (RIP). Additionally, the effect of NSUN2 on Nrf2 mRNA synthesis and localization was evaluated using an RNA fluorescence probe. Results: NSUN2 was downregulated, and liver tissue suffered significant pathological damage in the Dox group. The levels of ALT and AST significantly increased. NSUN2 interference exacerbated Dox-induced liver cell damage, which was reversed by NSUN2 overexpression. RIP demonstrated that NSUN2 recognized and bound to Nrf2 mRNA. Western blot analysis showed the protein level of Nrf2 in the NSUN2-WT group was significantly higher than that of the control group, whereas there was no significant change in Nrf2 level in the mutant NSUN2 group. Luciferase analysis demonstrated that NSUN2 could recognize and activate the Nrf2 5′UTR region of LO2 cells. In addition, RIP analysis revealed that ALYREF could recognize and bind to Nrf2 mRNA and that ALYREF controls the regulatory effect of NSUN2 on Nrf2. Conclusion: NSUN2 regulates Dox-induced liver cell damage by increasing Nrf2 mRNA m5C methylation to inhibit inhibiting antioxidant stress.

This study proposes the use of diamond-like carbon (DLC) deposited on polylactic acid (PLA) membranes as a biophysical mechanism for anti-adhesion barrier to encase ruptured tendons in tendon-injured rats. The results indicate that PLA/DLC composite membrane exhibits more efficient anti-adhesion effect than PLA membrane, with histological score decreasing from 3.12 ± 0.27 to 2.20 ± 0.22 and anti-adhesion effectiveness increasing from 21.61% to 44.72%. Mechanistically, the abundant C=O bond functional groups on the surface of DLC can reduce reactive oxygen species level effectively; thus, the phosphorylation of NF-κB and M1 polarization of macrophages are inhibited. Consequently, excessive inflammatory response augmented by M1 macrophage-originated cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is largely reduced. For biocompatibility evaluation, PLA/DLC membrane is slowly absorbed within tissue and displays prolonged barrier effects compared to traditional PLA membranes. Further studies show the DLC depositing decelerates the release of degradation product lactic acid and its induction of macrophage M2 polarization by interfering esterase and PLA ester bonds, which further delays the fibrosis process. It was found that the PLA/DLC membrane possess an efficient biophysical mechanism for treatment of peritendinous adhesion.

Our previous study found that the infarct-limiting effect of IPostC is abolished in the heart of diabetes whose cardiac expression of DJ-1 (also called PARK7, Parkinsonism associated deglycase) is reduced. However, the role and in particular the underlying mechanism of DJ-1 in the loss of sensitivity to IPostC-induced cardioprotection in diabetic hearts remains unclear. Methods: Streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetic rats were subjected to MI/R injury by occluding the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and followed by reperfusion. IPostC was induced by three cycles of 10s of reperfusion and ischemia at the onset of reperfusion. AAV9-CMV-DJ-1, AAV9-CMV-C106S-DJ-1 or AAV9-DJ-1 siRNA were injected via tail vein to either over-express or knock-down DJ-1 three weeks before inducing MI/R. Results: Diabetic rats subjected to MI/R exhibited larger infarct area, more severe oxidative injury concomitant with significantly reduced cardiac DJ-1 expression and increased PTEN expression as compared to non-diabetic rats. AAV9-mediated cardiac DJ-1 overexpression, but not the cardiac overexpression of DJ-1 mutant C106S, restored IPostC-induced cardioprotection and this effect was accompanied by increased cytoplasmic DJ-1 translocation toward nuclear and mitochondrial, reduced PTEN expression, and increased Nrf-2/HO-1 transcription. Our further study showed that AAV9-mediated targeted DJ-1 gene knockdown aggravated MI/R injury in diabetic hearts, and this exacerbation of MI/R injury was partially reversed by IPostC in the presence of PTEN inhibition or Nrf-2 activation. Conclusions: These findings suggest that DJ-1 preserves the cardioprotective effect of IPostC against MI/R injury in diabetic rats through nuclear and mitochondrial DJ-1 translocation and that inhibition of cardiac PTEN and activation of Nrf-2/HO-1 may represent the major downstream mechanisms whereby DJ-1 preserves the cardioprotective effect of IPostC in diabetes.

Experimental results show that the proposed tracking algorithm exhibits excellent tracking performance on seven benchmark datasets, especially on the aerial dataset UAV123, UAV20L, and UAV123@10fps, which presents the advantages of the novel method in dealing with fast motion and external interference.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",60,2024

Findings from a Canadian population-based study,BMC Oral Health,"[('University of Toronto', 'Toronto', 'Canada')]","© The Author(s) 2024.Background: In Canada, as in many other countries, private dental insurance addresses financial barriers to a great extent thereby facilitating access to dental care. That said, insurance does not guarantee affordability, as there are issues with the quality and level of coverage of insurance plans. As such, individuals facing barriers to dental care experience poorer oral health. Therefore, it is important to examine more keenly the socio-demographic attributes of people with private insurance to particularly identify those, who despite having insurance, face challenges in accessing dental care and experience poorer oral health. Methods: This study is a secondary data analysis of the most recent available cycle (2017-18) of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), a national cross-sectional survey. Univariate analysis was conducted to determine the characteristics of Ontarians with private insurance (n = 17,678 representing 6919,814 Ontarians)—bivariate analysis to explore their financial barriers to dental care, and how they perceive their oral health. Additionally, logistic regressions were conducted to identify relationships between covariates and outcome variables. Results: Analysis shows that the majority of those with private insurance do not experience cost barriers to dental care and perceive their oral health as good to excellent. However, specific populations, including those aged 20–39 years, and those earning less than $40,000, despite having private dental insurance, face significantly more cost barriers to access to care compared to their counterparts. Additionally, those with the lowest income (earning less than $20,000 annually) perceived their oral health as “fair to poor” more than those earning more. Adjusted estimates revealed that respondents aged 20–39 were six times more likely to report cost barriers to dental care and ten times more likely to visit the dentist only for emergencies than those aged 12–19. Additionally, those aged 40–59 were two times more likely to report poorer oral health status compared to those aged 12–19. Conclusion: Given the upcoming implementation of the Canadian Dental Care Plan, the results of this study can support in identifying vulnerable populations who currently are ineligible for the Plan but can be benefitted from the coverage.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",28,2024

Dogs are considered important reservoirs of T. penetrans in Brazil. The aim of this study was to determine the monthly insecticidal efficacy of a single oral administration of fluralaner at a dose of 10–18 mg/kg (Bravecto® 1-Month, also registered as Defenza® in some countries; MSD Animal Health) in dogs naturally infested with T. penetrans. Methods: This clinical trial was conducted in a rural community located in Ilhéus, Bahia, Brazil. A total of 64 dogs were selected and distributed in a completely randomized design between a treated group (TG) that received one single dose of Bravecto® 1-Month (Defenza®) and a negative control group (CG) that received no treatment. Each group was composed of 32 dogs. The evaluations took place on days 0, 7 ± 2, 14 ± 2, 21 ± 2, 28 ± 2, 35 ± 2, and 42 ± 2 post treatment, in which the dogs were inspected to evaluate the infestation stage and classify lesions associated with tungiasis. The primary efficacy was determined from the percentage of treated dogs free of fleas (stage II and III lesions) after administration of the formulation at each evaluation time. Secondary efficacy was based on the number of active lesions (stages II and III) in each group at each evaluation time. The clinical condition of the animals was defined based on the Severity Score for Acute Dog Tungiasis (SCADT), which is related to the number and severity of lesions. Results: The primary efficacy of the product was greater than 95.0% from days 7 to 21 and reached 100.0% between days 28 and 42, with a significant association between treatment and infestation decline (P < 0.025) between days 7 and 42. Secondary drug efficacy was greater than 99.9% from days 7 to 21, reaching 100.0% between days 28 and 42 (P < 0.05). The treated dogs also scored lower on the SCADT than the control animals did during the entire clinical evaluation period (P < 0.05). Conclusions: A single administration of Bravecto® 1-Month (Defenza®) was effective in eliminating Tunga penetrans infestations, as well as in preventing parasitism for at least 42 days after treatment.

The objectives of this study were to determine short and medium-term outcomes of children with CF admitted to PICU for acute respiratory failure due to pulmonary exacerbation and to identify prognosis factors. Methods: This retrospective monocentric study included patients less than 18 years old admitted to the PICU of a French university hospital between 2000 and 2020. Cox proportional hazard regression methods were used to determine prognosis factors of mortality or lung transplant. Results: Prior to PICU admission, the 29 patients included (median age 13.5 years) had a severe lung disease (median Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 s percentage predicted at 29%). Mortality rates were respectively 17%, 31%, 34%, 41% at discharge and at 3, 12 and 36 months post-discharge. Survival rates free of lung transplant were 34%, 32%, 24% and 17% respectively. Risk factors associated with mortality or lung transplant using the univariate analysis were female sex and higher pCO2 and chloride levels at PICU admission, and following pre admission characteristics: home respiratory and nutritional support, registration on lung transplant list and Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia bronchial colonization. Conclusion: Children with CF admitted to PICU for acute respiratory failure secondary to pulmonary exacerbations are at high risk of death, both in the short and medium terms. Lung transplant is their main chance of survival and should be considered early.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",41,2024

We found that the addition of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) to neodymium oxide (Nd2O3) resulted in a significant response, with an enlargement of the inhibition zone for bacterial species such as Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Specifically, the inhibition zone for S. aureus increased from 9.3 ± 0.5 mm for pure Nd2O3 to 16.7 ± 0.4 mm for the Ag/Nd2O3 nano-composite, while for E. coli, it increased from 8.8 ± 0.4 mm for Nd2O3 to 15.9 ± 0.3 mm for Ag/Nd2O3. Furthermore, the optical behavior of the composites showed a clear band-gap narrowing with the addition of Ag NPs, resulting in enhanced electronic localization. The direct and indirect transitions reduced from 6.7 to 6.1 eV and from 5.2 to 2.9 eV, respectively. Overall, these results suggest that the Ag/Nd2O3 nano-composite has potential applications in sensor industries and water treatment, thanks to its enhanced optical behavior, antibacterial performance, and efficient MB degradation capabilities. In terms of MB degradation, the Ag/Nd2O3 mixed system exhibited more efficient degradation compared to pure Nd2O3. After 150 min, the MB concentration in the mixed system decreased to almost half of its starting point, while pure Nd2O3 only reached 33%.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",67,2024

The relationships for type strains belong to these genera need to be carefully re-evaluated. Results: The relationships of Mesorhizobium complex are evaluated based on phylogenomic analyses and overall genome relatedness indices (OGRIs) of 61 type strains. According to the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on concatenated sequences of 539 core proteins and the tree constructed using the bac120 bacterial marker set from Genome Taxonomy Database, 65 type strains were grouped into 9 clusters. Moreover, 10 subclusters were identified based on the OGRIs including average nucleotide identity (ANI), average amino acid identity (AAI) and core-proteome average amino acid identity (cAAI), with AAI and cAAI showing a clear intra- and inter-(sub)cluster gaps of 77.40–80.91% and 83.98–86.16%, respectively. Combined with the phylogenetic trees and OGRIs, the type strains were reclassified into 15 genera. This list includes five defined genera Mesorhizobium, Aquamicrobium, Pseudaminobacter, Aminobacterand Tianweitania, among which 40/41 Mesorhizobium species and one Aminobacter species are canonical legume microsymbionts. The other nine (sub)clusters are classified as novel genera. Cluster III, comprising symbiotic M. alhagi and M. camelthorni, is classified as Allomesorhizobium gen. nov. Cluster VI harbored a single symbiotic species M. albiziae and is classified as Neomesorhizobium gen. nov.

It is used to analyze the structure and motion of the vocal fold. Aim and objective: To compare the stroboscopic findings of various vocal parameters such as symmetry, amplitude, periodicity, mucosal wave of vocal folds, and glottis closure before and after elective endotracheal intubation and to compare acoustic analysis of voice using fundamental frequency, intensity, maximum phonation time, and dysphonia severity index in patients before and after elective intubation, who were undergoing otological surgeries. It also assesses the correlation between changes in these vocal and acoustic parameters and the size of the endotracheal tube, duration of intubation, and number of attempts made during intubation. This study creates awareness and provides insights to avoid intubation-related vocal fold injury. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study involving 31 patients done in a Tertiary Care Centre. All patients who underwent otological surgeries by elective endotracheal intubation were included. All of them underwent stroboscopic and acoustic evaluation preoperatively, 24 h, and 7 days postoperatively. Results: Statistically significant changes in mucosal wave pattern score were observed in the 1st postoperative day that reverted to normal by the end of 7th postoperative day and in GRBAS which was significant at the end of both 1st and 7th POD. Other parameters like fundamental frequency, intensity, DSI, MPT, amplitude, symmetry, periodicity, and glottis closure remain unaltered. There was a moderate positive correlation between the duration of intubation (minutes) and mucosal wave 1st POD (P-value: 0.003). Conclusion: The majority of the patients (61%) had normal laryngeal structures. A total of 39% had evidence of injury, the most common being right vocal fold hemorrhage improved by the end of 7th postoperative day and became normal.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",15,2024

Although inter-DCIs based on intensity modulation and direct detection (IM-DD) along with wavelength-division multiplexing technologies exhibit power-efficient and large-capacity properties, the requirement of multiple laser sources leads to high costs and limited scalability, and the chromatic dispersion (CD) restricts the transmission length of optical signals. Here we propose a scalable on-chip parallel IM-DD data transmission system enabled by a single-soliton Kerr microcomb and a reconfigurable microring resonator-based CD compensator. We experimentally demonstrate an aggregate line rate of 1.68 Tbit/s over a 20-km-long SMF. The extrapolated energy consumption for CD compensation of 40-km-SMFs is ~0.3 pJ/bit, which is calculated as being around 6 times less than that of the commercial 400G-ZR coherent transceivers.

Evidence suggests that STH can support individuals with mental ill-health, however, current commissioning of STH within mental health care is limited. This study aimed to understand the barriers to commissioning STH in mental health care and to identify potential solutions to barriers, to support more widespread availability of services. Methods: Individuals with a role in mental health care commissioning from across the UK were invited to take part in semi-structured interviews via zoom. Interviews explored factors influencing the mental health services they commission or refer to, their perception of the role of STH in mental health care and the barriers to commissioning STH, together with potential solutions to any barriers identified. Results: Commissioners identified a lack of knowledge of STH and evidence of its effectiveness, and a culture which prioritises traditional medical models, as barriers to commissioning. Challenges for STH providers in responding to large-scale commissioning requirements were also highlighted as a barrier. Conclusions: To upscale commissioning of STH in mental health care, STH interventions need to be embedded within NHS priorities and information on STH services and their effectiveness needs to be easily accessible to practitioners. The sector should also be supported in working collaboratively to enable commissioning of services at scale.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",50,2024

Method: Deans of medical education (or equivalent) at 214 allopathic or osteopathic medical schools in Canada and the United States were invited to complete a 36-question, Web-based questionnaire between June 2021 and September 2022. The main outcome measured was reported hours of LGBTQI + health-related curricular content. Results: Of 214 schools, 100 (46.7%) responded, of which 85 (85.0%) fully completed the questionnaire. Compared to 5 median hours dedicated to LGBTQI + health-related in a 2011 study, the 2022 median reported time was 11 h (interquartile range [IQR], 6–16 h, p < 0.0001). Two UME institutions (2.4%; 95% CI, 0.0%-5.8%) reported 0 h during the pre-clerkship phase; 21 institutions (24.7%; CI, 15.5%-33.9%) reported 0 h during the clerkship phase; and 1 institution (1.2%; CI, 0%-3.5%) reported 0 h across the curriculum. Median US allopathic clerkship hours were significantly different from US osteopathic clerkship hours (4 h [IQR, 1–6 h] versus 0 h [IQR, 0–0 h]; p = 0.01). Suggested strategies to increase content included more curricular material focusing on LGBTQI + health and health disparities at 55 schools (64.7%; CI, 54.6%-74.9%), more faculty willing and able to teach LGBTQI + -related content at 49 schools (57.7%; CI, 47.1%-68.2%), and more evidence-based research on LGBTQI + health and health disparities at 24 schools (28.2%; CI, 18.7%-37.8%). Conclusion: Compared to a 2011 study, the median reported time dedicated to LGBTQI + health-related topics in 2022 increased across US and Canadian UME institutions, but the breadth, efficacy, or quality of instruction continued to vary substantially. Despite the increased hours, this still falls short of the number of hours based on recommended LGBTQI + health competencies from the Association of American Medical Colleges. While most deans of medical education reported their institutions’ coverage of LGBTQI + health as ‘fair,’ ‘good,’ or ‘very good,’ there continues to be a call from UME leadership to increase curricular content.

The length of UTRs and the composition of regulatory elements within them are known to vary substantially across genes, but little is known about the reasons for this variation in humans. Here, we set out to determine whether this variation, specifically in 5’UTRs, correlates with gene dosage sensitivity. Results: We investigate 5’UTR length, the number of alternative transcription start sites, the potential for alternative splicing, the number and type of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) and the propensity of 5’UTRs to form secondary structures. We explore how these elements vary by gene tolerance to loss-of-function (LoF; using the LOEUF metric), and in genes where changes in dosage are known to cause disease. We show that LOEUF correlates with 5’UTR length and complexity. Genes that are most intolerant to LoF have longer 5’UTRs, greater TSS diversity, and more upstream regulatory elements than their LoF tolerant counterparts. We show that these differences are evident in disease gene-sets, but not in recessive developmental disorder genes where LoF of a single allele is tolerated. Conclusions: Our results confirm the importance of post-transcriptional regulation through 5'UTRs in tight regulation of mRNA and protein levels, particularly for genes where changes in dosage are deleterious and lead to disease. Finally, to support gene-based investigation we release a web-based browser tool, VuTR, that supports exploration of the composition of individual 5'UTRs and the impact of genetic variation within them.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",50,2024

However, the heating efficiency of MNPs is primarily influenced by their magnetization, size distribution, magnetic anisotropy, dipolar interaction, amplitude, and frequency of the applied field, the MNPs with high heating efficiency are still challenging. In this study, a comprehensive experimental analysis has been conducted on single-domain magnetic nanoparticles (SDMNPs) for evaluating effective anisotropy, assessing the impact of particle-intrinsic factors and experimental conditions on self-heating efficiency in both noninteracting and interacting systems, with a particular focus on the dipolar interaction effect. The study successfully reconciles conflicting findings on the interaction effects in the agglomeration and less agglomerated arrangements for MFH applications. The results suggest that effective control of dipolar interactions can be achieved by encapsulating Chitosan/Dextran in the synthesized MNPs.

While warhead reactivities are commonly measured with assays, a computational model to predict warhead reactivities could be useful for several aspects of the covalent inhibitor design process. Studies have shown correlations between covalent warhead reactivities and quantum mechanic (QM) properties that describe important aspects of the covalent reaction mechanism. However, the models from these studies are often linear regression equations and can have limitations associated with their usage. Applications of machine learning (ML) models to predict covalent warhead reactivities with QM descriptors are not extensively seen in the literature. This study uses QM descriptors, calculated at different levels of theory, to train ML models to predict reactivities of covalent acrylamide warheads. The QM/ML models are compared with linear regression models built upon the same QM descriptors and with ML models trained on structure-based features like Morgan fingerprints and RDKit descriptors. Experiments show that the QM/ML models outperform the linear regression models and the structure-based ML models, and literature test sets demonstrate the power of the QM/ML models to predict reactivities of unseen acrylamide warhead scaffolds. Ultimately, these QM/ML models are effective, computationally feasible tools that can expedite the design of new covalent inhibitors.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",73,2024

To demonstrate this transformative process, we present a real-life case study where a company seeks to automate the classification of their textual data rather than relying on manual methods. Transitioning to automated classification involves deploying machine learning models, which rely on pre-labeled datasets for training and making predictions on new data. However, upon receiving the dataset from the company, we faced challenges due to the imbalanced distribution of labels and moderately large label spaces. To tackle text classification with such a business dataset, we evaluated four distinct methods for multi-label text classification: fine-tuned Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), Binary Relevance, Classifier Chains, and Label Powerset. The results revealed that fine-tuned BERT significantly outperformed the other methods across key metrics like Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, and Recall. Binary Relevance also displayed competence in handling the dataset effectively, while Classifier Chains and Label Powerset exhibited comparatively less impressive performance. These findings highlight the remarkable effectiveness of fine-tuned BERT model and the Binary Relevance classifier in multi-label text classification tasks, particularly when dealing with imbalanced training datasets and moderately large label spaces. This positions them as valuable assets for businesses aiming to automate data classification in the digital transformation era.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",30,2024

Methods: A total of 398 eyes (125 PACD eyes with zonular instability, 133 PACD eyes with zonular stability, and 140 cataract patient controls) of 398 patients who underwent cataract surgery combined or not glaucoma surgery between January 2021 and January 2023 were enrolled. The crystalline lens parameters were measured by CASIA2 AS-OCT. Then, logistic regression was performed to evaluate the risk factors associated with zonular instability. Results: The results revealed that PACD eyes had a more anterior lens equator position, a steeper anterior curvature of lens, shorter Axial Length (AL), shallower Anterior Chamber Distance (ACD), higher Lens Vault (LV) and thicker Lens Thickness (LT), when compared to eyes in the cataract control group. Furthermore, PACD eyes in the zonular instability group had steeper front R, front Rs and Front Rf, flatter back Rf, thicker lens anterior part thickness, higher lens anterior-to-posterior part thickness ratios, shallower ACD, and greater LV, when compared to PACD eyes with zonular stability. The logistic regression analysis, which was adjusted for age and gender, revealed that zonular instability was positively correlated with anterior part thickness, lens anterior-to-posterior part thickness ratio, and LV, but was negatively correlated with lens anterior radius and ACD. Conclusion: Steeper anterior curvature, increased lens anterior part thickness, higher anterior-to-posterior part thickness ratio, shallower ACD, and greater LV are the anatomic features of PACD eyes associated with zonular instability.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",21,2024

In this multicenter, randomized, observer-blinded, phase 3 study, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)–naïve participants (aged ≥ 18 years, without prior infection or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2) were randomized (1:1) to receive either S-268019-b or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 as two intramuscular injections given 28 days apart. Participants who provided consent for a booster administration received S-268019-b at Day 211. The primary endpoint was SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (NAb) titer on Day 57; the key secondary endpoint was the seroconversion rate for SARS-CoV-2 NAb titer on Day 57. Other endpoints included anti–SARS-CoV-2 S-protein immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibody titer and safety. The demographic and baseline characteristics were generally comparable between S-268019-b (n = 611) and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (n = 610) groups. S-268019-b showed superior immunogenicity over ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, based on their geometric mean titers (GMTs) and GMT ratios of SARS-CoV-2 NAb on Day 57 by cytopathic effect assay (GMT [95% confidence interval {CI}] 19.92 [18.68, 21.23] versus 3.63 [3.41, 3.87]; GMT ratio [95% CI] 5.48 [5.01, 6.00], respectively; two-sided p-values < 0.0001).

Evidence points to an important role for post-transcriptional control of gene expression in germinating pollen tubes, which could be aided by RNA-binding proteins. Results: In this study, a genome-wide investigation of the LARP proteins in eight plant species was performed. The LARP proteins were classified into three families based on a phylogenetic analysis. The gene structure, conserved motifs, cis-acting elements in the promoter, and gene expression profiles were investigated to provide a comprehensive overview of the evolutionary history and potential functions of ZmLARP genes in maize. Moreover, ZmLARP6c1 was specifically expressed in pollen and ZmLARP6c1 was localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm in maize protoplasts. Overexpression of ZmLARP6c1 enhanced the percentage pollen germination compared with that of wild-type pollen.

Specifically, we consider a multilayer network defined by multiple edge-weighted, potentially directed, graphs over the same set of nodes with each graph representing one layer of the network and no inter-layer edges. As in the standard eigenvector centrality construction, the importance of each node in a given layer is based on the weighted sum of the importance of adjacent nodes in that same layer. Unlike standard eigenvector centrality, we assume that the adjacency relationship and the importance of adjacent nodes may be based on distinct layers. Importantly, this type of centrality constraint is only partially supported by existing frameworks for multilayer eigenvector centrality that use edges between nodes in different layers to capture inter-layer dependencies. For our model, constrained, layer-specific eigenvector centrality values are defined by a system of independent eigenvalue problems and dependent pseudo-eigenvalue problems, whose solution can be efficiently realized using an interleaved power iteration algorithm. We refer to this model, and the associated algorithm, as the Constrained Multilayer Centrality (CMLC) method. The characteristics of this approach, and of standard techniques based on inter-layer edges, are demonstrated on both a simple multilayer network and on a range of random graph models.

It is categorized as 'vulnerable to extinction' with only 6057 registered animals in 2022, yet no comprehensive analyses of its molecular diversity have been performed to date. The aim of this study was to analyse the origin, genetic diversity, and genomic signatures of selection in Rendena cattle using data from samples collected in 2000 and 2018, and shed light on the breed's evolution and conservation needs. Results: Genetic analysis revealed that the Rendena breed shares genetic components with various Alpine and Po valley breeds, with a marked genetic proximity to the Original Braunvieh breed, reflecting historical restocking efforts across the region. The breed shows signatures of selection related to both milk and meat production, environmental adaptation and immune response, the latter being possibly the result of multiple rinderpest epidemics that swept across the Alps in the eighteenth century. An analysis of the Rendena cattle population spanning 18 years showed an increase in the mean level of inbreeding over time, which is confirmed by the mean number of runs of homozygosity per individual, which was larger in the 2018 sample. Conclusions: The Rendena breed, while sharing a common origin with Brown Swiss, has developed distinct traits that enable it to thrive in the Alpine environment and make it highly valued by local farmers. Preserving these adaptive features is essential, not only for maintaining genetic diversity and enhancing the ability of this traditional animal husbandry to adapt to changing environments, but also for guaranteeing the resilience and sustainability of both this livestock system and the livelihoods within the Rendena valley.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",71,2024

We had proved that Fusobacterium periodonticum (F.p) was higher abundance in Esophageal cancer(EC)tissues. Bioinformation analysis found that BCT was a key virulence protein of F.p. However, little is known about the role and mechanism of BCT in EC. This study aimed to recognize the key virulence protein of F.p and explore the mechanism of BCT in promoting EC. Methods: We constructed a eukaryotic expression vector and purified the recombinant protein BCT. CCK8 used to analyzed the activity of EC after treated by different concentration of BCT. UPLC-MS/MS and ELISA used to detect the metabonomics and metabolites. The ability of migration and invasion was completed by transwell assay. RT-QPCR, WB used to analyze the expression of relevant genes. Results: Our data showed that BCT was higher expression in EC tumor tissues (p < 0.05) and BCT in 20 µg/mL promoted the survival, invasion and migration of EC cells (EC109) (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, UPLC-MS/MS results suggested that BCT resulted in an augmentation of hypotaurine metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, tryptophan metabolism, citrate cycle activity in EC109. The metabolic changes resulted in decreasing in glucose and pyruvate levels but increase in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and lactic acid (LA) as well as the expression of glucose transporter 1, Hexokinase 2, LDH which regulated the glycolysis were all changed (p < 0.05). The BCT treatment upregulated the expression of TLR4, Akt, HIF-1α (p < 0.05) which regulated the production of LA. Furthermore, LA stimulation promoted the expression of GPR81, Wnt, and β-catenin (p < 0.05), thereby inducing EMT and metastasis in EC109 cells. Conclusion: Altogether, these findings identified that impact of BCT in regulation of glycolysis in EC109 and its involves the TLR4/Akt/HIF-1α pathway. Meanwhile, glycolysis increasing the release of LA and promote the EMT of EC109 by GPR81/Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.

Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are a rare subset of leukemic cells that promote the development and progression of AML, and eradication of LSCs is critical for effective control of this disease. Emetine is an FDA-approved antiparasitic drug with antitumor properties; however, little is known about its potential against LSCs. Herein, we explored the antileukemic potential of emetine, focusing on its effects on AML stem/progenitor cells. Emetine exhibited potent cytotoxic activity both in hematologic and solid cancer cells and induced AML cell differentiation. Emetine also inhibited AML stem/progenitor cells, as evidenced by decreased expression of CD34, CD97, CD99, and CD123 in KG-1a cells, indicating anti-AML stem/progenitor cell activities. The administration of emetine at a dosage of 10 mg/kg for two weeks showed no significant toxicity and significantly reduced xenograft leukemic growth in vivo. NF-κB activation was reduced in emetine-treated KG-1a cells, as shown by reduced phospho-NF-κB p65 (S529) and nuclear NF-κB p65. DNA fragmentation, YO-PRO-1 staining, mitochondrial depolarization and increased levels of active caspase-3 and cleaved PARP (Asp214) were detected in emetine-treated KG-1a cells. Moreover, treatment with the pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD(OMe)-FMK partially prevented the apoptotic cell death induced by emetine. Emetine treatment also increased cellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, and emetine-induced apoptosis in KG-1a cells was partially prevented by the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, indicating that emetine induces apoptosis, at least in part, by inducing oxidative stress. Overall, these studies indicate that emetine is a novel potential anti-AML agent with promising activity against stem/progenitor cells, encouraging the development of further studies aimed at its clinical application.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",39,2024

However, the molecular mechanisms of how SpRY recognizes all potential PAM sequences remains unclear. Here, we combine structural and biochemical approaches to determine how SpRY interrogates DNA and recognizes target sites. Divergent PAM sequences can be accommodated through conformational flexibility within the PAM-interacting region, which facilitates tight binding to off-target DNA sequences. Nuclease activation occurs ~1000-fold slower than for Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9, enabling us to directly visualize multiple on-pathway intermediate states. Experiments with SpG position it as an intermediate enzyme between Cas9 and SpRY.

With thrombin, a serine protease that plays a crucial role in maintaining homeostasis and promoting blood clotting, as detection target, this study introduces a novel approach for sensitive and accurate measurement of protein biomarker expression by utilization of cyclic reverse transcription (CRT) in combination with the self-priming hairpin-triggered CRISPR-Cas12a system. In this method, an elegantly designed sensing probe is utilized to specifically bind with the thrombin protein and convert the protein signals to nucleic acids signals, following by the CRT and CRISPR-Cas12a system-based signal amplification strategy. Taking the merit of the two-stage amplification, this assay has the capability to detect thrombin at the fM level. In addition, due to the aptamer sequence’s strong selectivity to thrombin protein and the dual-check process in the signal amplification process (first in the CRT and second in the CRISPR system), the proposed test demonstrates exceptional specificity in detecting thrombin. By re-designing the sensing probe, the established method could be extended to various protein biomarker detection. Ultimately, this assay has successfully enabled the accurate evaluation of biomarker levels in constructed clinical samples, showing significant potential for application in the realm of clinical molecular diagnosis.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",24,2024

Once partnerships are established with end-users, there is less guidance about processes research teams can use to successfully incorporate end-user feedback. The current study describes the use of a brief reflections process to systematically examine and evaluate the impact of end-user feedback on study conduct. Methods: The Comparative Effectiveness of Trauma-Focused and Non-Trauma- Focused Treatment Strategies for PTSD among those with Co-Occurring SUD (COMPASS) study was a randomized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of trauma-focused psychotherapy versus non-trauma-focused psychotherapy for Veterans with co-occurring posttraumatic stress disorder and substance use disorder who were entering substance use treatment within the Department of Veterans Affairs. We developed and paired a process of “brief reflections” with our end-user engagement methods as part of a supplemental evaluation of the COMPASS study engagement plan. Brief reflections were 30-minute semi-structured discussions with the COMPASS Team following meetings with three study engagement panels about feedback received regarding study issues. To evaluate the impact of panel feedback, 16 reflections were audio-recorded, transcribed, rapidly analyzed, and integrated with other study data sources. Results: Brief reflections revealed that the engagement panels made recommended changes in eight areas: enhancing recruitment; study assessment completion; creating uniformity across Study Coordinators; building Study Coordinator connection to Veteran participants; mismatch between study procedures and clinical practice; therapist skill with patients with active substance use; therapist burnout; and dissemination of study findings. Some recommendations positively impact study conduct while others had mixed impact. Reflections were iterative and led to emergent processes that included revisiting previously discussed topics, cross-pollination of ideas across panels, and sparking solutions amongst the Team when the panels did not make any recommendations or recommendations were not feasible. Conclusions: When paired with end-user engagement methods, brief reflections can facilitate systematic examination of end-user input, particularly when the engagement strategy is robust. Reflections offer a forum of accountability for researchers to give careful thought to end-user recommendations and make timely improvements to the study conduct.

The primary mechanism of action of triazoles is through the specific inhibition of a cytochrome P450 14-α-sterol demethylase enzyme, Cyp51A/B, resulting in depletion of cellular ergosterol. Here, we uncover a clinically relevant secondary mechanism of action for triazoles within the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway. We provide evidence that triazole-mediated inhibition of Cyp51A/B activity generates sterol intermediate perturbations that are likely decoded by the sterol sensing functions of HMG-CoA reductase and Insulin-Induced Gene orthologs as increased pathway activity. This, in turn, results in negative feedback regulation of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting step of sterol biosynthesis. We also provide evidence that HMG-CoA reductase sterol sensing domain mutations previously identified as generating resistance in clinical isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus partially disrupt this triazole-induced feedback. Therefore, our data point to a secondary mechanism of action for the triazoles: induction of HMG-CoA reductase negative feedback for downregulation of ergosterol biosynthesis pathway activity. Abrogation of this feedback through acquired mutations in the HMG-CoA reductase sterol sensing domain diminishes triazole antifungal activity against fungal pathogens and underpins HMG-CoA reductase-mediated resistance.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",56,2024

Though there are still a variety of flaws in the treatment of some infectious diseases, metabolomics provides a fresh perspective to explore the relationship between T2DM and infection. Our research aimed to investigate the association between plasma free amino acids (PFAAs) and T2DM complicated with infection in Chinese patients. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from May 2015 to August 2016. We retrieved the medical records of 1032 inpatients with T2DM from Liaoning Medical University First Affiliated Hospital and we used mass spectrometry to quantify 23 PFAAs. Infections contained 15 individual categories that could be retrieved from the database. Principal component analysis was used to extract factors of PFAAs. Multi-variable binary logistic regression was used to obtain odds ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Among 1032 inpatients,109 (10.6%) had infectious diseases. Six factors, accounting for 68.6% of the total variance, were extracted. Factor 4 consisted of Glu, Asp and Orn. Factor 5 consisted of Hcy and Pip. After adjusting for potential confounders, factor 4 was positively correlated with T2DM complicated with infection in Chinese T2DM patients (OR: 1.27, 95%CI: 1.06–1.52). Individual Hcy in factor 5 was positively associated with T2DM complicated with infection (OR: 1.33, 95%CI: 1.08–1.64). Furthermore, factor 4 (OR: 1.44, 95%CI: 1.11–1.87), Orn (OR: 1.01, 95%CI: 1.00-1.02) and Hcy (OR: 1.56, 95%CI: 1.14–3.14) were positively associated with bacterial infection in Chinese T2DM patients, while factor 5 (OR: 0.71, 95%CI: 0.50-1.00) was negatively associated with bacterial infection. Conclusions: Urea cycle-related metabolites (Orn, Asp, Glu) and Hcy were positively associated with T2DM complicated with infection in China. Orn and Hcy were positively associated with bacterial infection in T2DM patients in China.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",55,2024

Methods: Two bibliographic databases (PubMed and Embase, 1970–2017) were systematically searched for RCTs in RRMM that reported OS and PFS, followed by an updated search of studies published between 2010 and 2022 in 3 databases (Embase, MEDLINE, and EBM Reviews, 2010–2022). The association between median PFS and median OS was assessed using the nonparametric Spearman rank and parametric Pearson correlation coefficients. Subsequently, the quantitative relationship between PFS and OS was assessed using weighted least-squares regression adjusted for covariates including age, sex, and publication year. Study arms were weighted by the number of patients in each arm. Results: A total of 31 RCTs (56 treatment arms, 10,450 patients with RRMM) were included in the analysis. The average median PFS and median OS were 7.1 months (SD 5.5) and 28.1 months (SD 11.8), respectively. The Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients between median PFS and median OS were 0.80 (P < 0.0001) and 0.79 (P < 0.0001), respectively. In individual treatment arms of RRMM trials, each 1-month increase in median PFS was associated with a 1.72-month (95% CI 1.26–2.17) increase in median OS. Conclusion: Analysis of the relationship between PFS and OS incorporating more recent studies in RRMM further substantiates the use of PFS to predict OS in RRMM.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",42,2024

Methods: We tested wild mosquito populations from six communes in Benin against various pyrethroid (permethrin 0.75%, alphacypermethrin 0.05%, and deltamethrin 0.05%) using WHO tube tests. Additionally, we exposed mosquitoes to chlorfenapyr 100 µg/ml using the CDC bottle bioassay method. A subset of mosquitoes underwent biochemical and PCR tests to check the overexpression of metabolic enzymes and the Kdr L1014F mutation. We evaluated the effectiveness of Olyset® Plus, PermaNet® 3.0, and Interceptor® G2 nets using cone and tunnel tests on both laboratory and field populations of An. gambiae. Results: Overall, the highest mortality rate was 60% with pyrethroid and 98 to100% with chlorfenapyr. In cone tests, all three types of nets induced mortality rates above 80% in the susceptible laboratory strain of An. gambiae. Notably, Olyset® Plus showed the highest mortality rates for pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes in cone tests, ranging from 81.03% (95% CI: 68.59–90.13) in Djougou to 96.08% (95% CI: 86.54–99.52) in Akpro-Missérété. PermaNet® 3.0 had variable rates, from 42.5% (95% CI: 27.04–59.11) in Djougou to 58.54% (95% CI: 42.11–73.68) in Porto-Novo. However, revealed good results for Interceptor® G2, with 94% (95% CI: 87.40–97.77) mortality and 89.09% blood sampling inhibition in local populations of An. gambiae. In comparison, Interceptor® had lower rates of 17% (95% CI: 10.23–25.82) and 60%, respectively. Conclusion: These results suggest that tunnel tests are effective for evaluating dual-active ingredient nets. Additionally, Interceptor® G2 and PBO nets like Olyset® Plus could be considered as alternatives against pyrethroid-resistant mosquitoes.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",48,2024

Our method iterates between imputing missing spin states given current coupling strengths and re-estimating couplings from completed spin state data. Central to our approach is the novel application of adaptive l1 regularization on updating coupling strengths, which features an automatic adjustment of the regularization strength throughout the iterative inference process. By doing so, we aim at preventing over-fitting and enforcing the sparsity of couplings without access to ground truth parameters. We demonstrate that this approach accurately recovers parameters and imputes missing spins even with substantial missing data and short time series, providing improvements in the inference of Ising model parameters even for relatively small sample sizes.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",39,2024

Resulting hyperthyroidism can precipitate cardiac complications, including cardiac ischemia and myocardial infarction, although this has only been described in a few case reports. Case presentation: We present here a clinical scenario involving a 66-year-old male Caucasian patient under Amiodarone for atrial fibrillation, who developed AIT. In the presence of dyspnea, multiple cardiovascular risk factors and ECG abnormalities, a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, showing inferobasal hypokinesia. This led to further investigations through a cardiac PET-CT, where cardiac ischemia was suspected. Ultimately, the coronary angiography revealed no abnormalities. Nonetheless, these extensive cardiologic investigations led to a delay in initiating an emergency endovascular revascularization for acute-on-chronic left limb ischemia. Although initial treatment using Carbimazole was not successful after three weeks, the patient reached euthyroidism after completion of the treatment with Prednisone so that eventually thyroidectomy was not performed. Endovascular revascularization was finally performed after more than one month. Conclusions: We discuss here cardiac abnormalities in patients with AIT, which may be due to relative ischemia secondary to increased metabolic demand during hyperthyroidism. Improvement of cardiac complications is expected through an optimal AIT therapy including medical therapy as the primary approach and, when necessary, thyroidectomy. Cardiac investigations in the context of AIT should be carefully considered and may not justify delaying other crucial interventions. If considered mandatory, diagnostic procedures such as coronary angiography should be preferred to functional testing.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",29,2024

None have assessed the potential mediating role of the LMM between degenerative pathology and 12-month clinical outcomes. This prospective cohort study used baseline and 12-month follow-up data from 569 patients conservatively managed for low back or back-related leg pain to estimate the effects of aggregate degenerative lumbar MRI findings and LMM quality on 12-month low back and leg pain intensity (0–10) and disability (0–23) outcomes, and explored the mediating role of LMM quality between degenerative findings and 12-month clinical outcomes. Adjusted mixed effects generalized linear models separately estimated the effect of aggregate spinal pathology and LMM quality. Mediation models estimated the direct and indirect effects of pathology on leg pain, and pathology and LMM quality on leg pain, respectively. Multivariable analysis identified a leg pain rating change of 0.99 [0.14; 1.84] (unstandardized beta coefficients [95% CI]) in the presence of ≥ 4 pathologies, and a disability rating change of − 0.65 [− 0.14; − 1.16] for each 10% increase in muscle quality, but no effect on back pain intensity. Muscle quality had a non-significant mediating role (13.4%) between pathology and leg pain intensity. The number of different pathologies present demonstrated a small effect on 12-month leg pain intensity outcomes, while higher LMM quality had a direct effect on 12-month disability ratings but no mediating effect between pathology and leg pain. The relations between degenerative pathology, LMM quality, and pain-related outcomes appear complex and may include independent pathways.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",50,2024

However, more is needed to know about speaking up and instruments to assess it in the Korean context. Therefore, we assessed the psychometric properties of the Korean version of the Speaking Up about Patient Safety Questionnaire (KSUPS-Q) for measuring speaking up-related behavior and climate among nurses. Methods: The translation and adaptation process followed the guidelines of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research and the World Health Organization. Content validity was assessed by a six-member expert panel using the content validity index. In total, 314 nurses participated in an online survey to examine the psychometric properties. Internal consistencies were tested using Cronbach’s alpha and McDonald’s omega. Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to examine the subscales’ construct. The convergent validity of the speaking up-related climate scale was assessed by testing correlations with teamwork and safety climate domains of the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire. In addition, we investigated the convergent validity of the speaking up-related behavior scale by examining its correlation with the climate scale. Results: The reliability of the 11-item behavior scale was satisfactory. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed that a three-subscale model (perceived concerns, withholding voice, and speaking up) was appropriate (CFI = 0.98, TLI = 0.98, and SRMR = 0.05). Furthermore, the 11-item climate scale demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency. A three-subscale model (psychological safety, encouraging environment, and resignation) was confirmed (CFI = 0.98, TLI = 0.97, and SRMR = 0.05). The convergent validity of the climate scale was verified based on correlations with the teamwork (r = 0.68, p < 0.001) and safety climate (r = 0.68, p < 0.001) domains of the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire. In addition, speaking up-related behavior and climate showed a significant association, indicating that the behavior scale is conceptually valid. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the KSUPS-Q is a valid and reliable instrument in Korea. This instrument can help nurse managers simultaneously monitor the behavior and climate of their organizations and evaluate the outcomes of interventions to enhance speaking up. Future research is needed to explore diverse factors contributing to speaking up, including clinical roles, team relationships, and supportive culture, to identify areas requiring further improvement.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",52,2024

The true incidence of endometriosis of the appendix is currently unknown. Since symptoms often overlap with those of acute appendicitis, endometriosis of the appendix presents a diagnostic challenge in the emergency department. This large retrospective study investigates the incidence and perioperative clinical, radiologic, and laboratory findings, as well as possible differences between patients with and without endometriosis. Methods: Data from consecutive patients who underwent appendectomy for suspected appendicitis without a history of endometriosis were analyzed. Perioperative clinical, laboratory, perioperative, and histopathologic findings were compared between women with and without endometriosis. Results: Between January 2008 and June 2023, 2484 consecutive patients without a history of endometriosis underwent urgent appendectomy for suspected appendicitis. Endometriosis was detected on histopathologic examination in 17 (0.7%) patients. Signs of appendicitis were found less frequently on ultrasound in the endometriosis group compared to the non-endometriosis group (23.4% vs. 61.5%; p = 0.002; OR = 0.193; 95% CI 0.063–0.593). There were no differences in physical examination findings, duration of symptoms, degree of inflammation, surgical outcomes, or complication rates. Conclusion: The incidence of endometriosis of the appendix in patients undergoing appendectomy for suspected appendicitis was higher than suggested by data from autopsy series and populations with biopsy-proven endometriosis. Patients with endometriosis of the appendix were less likely to have a positive ultrasound finding, but perioperative and histopathologic findings and severity of inflammation did not differ from patients without endometriosis, presenting diagnostic challenges for clinicians.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",26,2024

This paper explores GPs’ intentions to remain in rural China and how their policy perception and job satisfaction predict the intentions. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, online survey from December 2021 to February 2022 to investigate GPs’ perception towards NCSP, job satisfaction, and intentions to remain in rural area. Eligible participants were GPs who were required to provide health services as part of NCSP at township health centres of 9 provinces which could represent all NCSP GPs in China. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were performed to explore the associations between policy perceptions, job satisfaction, and intentions to remain. Results: Of 3615 GPs included in the analysis, 442 (12.2%) would like to remain in rural area and 1266 (35.0%) were unsure.

The rapid escalation of the coronavirus has led to the scientific community engagement, continually seeking solutions to ensure the comfort and safety of society. Understanding the joint impact of medical and non-medical interventions on COVID-19 spread is essential for making public health decisions that control the pandemic. This paper introduces two novel hybrid machine-learning ensembles that combine supervised and unsupervised learning for COVID-19 data classification and regression. The study utilizes publicly available COVID-19 outbreak and potential predictive features in the USA dataset, which provides information related to the outbreak of COVID-19 disease in the US, including data from each of 3142 US counties from the beginning of the epidemic (January 2020) until June 2021. The developed hybrid hierarchical classifiers outperform single classification algorithms. The best-achieved performance metrics for the classification task were Accuracy = 0.912, ROC-AUC = 0.916, and F1-score = 0.916. The proposed hybrid hierarchical ensemble combining both supervised and unsupervised learning allows us to increase the accuracy of the regression task by 11% in terms of MSE, 29% in terms of the area under the ROC, and 43% in terms of the MPP metric. Thus, using the proposed approach, it is possible to predict the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths based on demographic, geographic, climatic, traffic, public health, social-distancing-policy adherence, and political characteristics with sufficiently high accuracy. The study reveals that virus pressure is the most important feature in COVID-19 spread for classification and regression analysis. Five other significant features were identified to have the most influence on COVID-19 spread. The combined ensembling approach introduced in this study can help policymakers design prevention and control measures to avoid or minimize public health threats in the future.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",28,2024

Our combined results demonstrate that land conversion to agricultural land results in taxonomic and functional homogenization of soil bacteria, mainly driven by the increase in the geographic ranges of taxa in croplands. We find that 20% of phylotypes are decreased and 23% are increased by land conversion, with croplands enriched in Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadota, Planctomycetota, Myxcoccota and Latescibacterota. Although there is no significant difference in functional composition between natural ecosystems and agricultural land, functional genes involved in nitrogen fixation, phosphorus mineralization and transportation are depleted in cropland. Our results provide a global insight into the consequences of land-use change on soil microbial taxonomic and functional diversity.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",94,2024

Methods: A comprehensive search of multiple databases, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science, was conducted to identify relevant studies investigating the relationship between hyperthyroidism and ED in men. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Newcastle‒Ottawa Quality Rating Scale, and a meta-analysis was performed using Stata 16.0 and RevMan 5.3 software. Results: A total of four papers encompassing 25,519 study subjects were included in the analysis. Among these, 6,429 individuals had hyperthyroidism, while 19,090 served as controls. The overall prevalence of ED in patients with hyperthyroidism was determined to be 31.1% (95% CI 0.06–0.56). In patients with uncomplicated hyperthyroidism, the incidence of ED was 21.9% (95% CI 0.05–0.38). The combined odds ratio (OR) for the four studies was 1.73 (OR: 1.73; 95% CI [1.46–2.04]; p <.00001). Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate a higher incidence of ED in patients with hyperthyroidism. These results provide valuable information for healthcare professionals and can facilitate discussions surrounding appropriate treatment options for ED in patients with hyperthyroidism.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",44,2024

Changing from one weight-loss diet to another at the time of the plateau could instigate renewed weight loss. Therefore, our secondary analysis aimed to assess trajectory of weight loss in a 12-month, randomized, cross-over study. Forty-two adults were randomized to eat a healthy low-fat or healthy low-carbohydrate diet for 6 months then switched to the opposite diet for an additional 6 months. Regardless of diet assignment, participants experienced rapid initial weight loss, which slowed between 3 to 6 months. After switching diets at 6 months, weight modestly decreased until 9 months, but at a rate slower than the initial 3 months and slower than the rate from 3 to 6 months. This suggests that the weight loss plateau typically seen at 6 months is physiological and cannot be overcome by simply switching to a different weight-loss diet.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",44,2024

Among the innovations is the use of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) that is effective against Plasmodium falciparum. Generic artemether–lumefantrine (AL) is used to treat uncomplicated malaria after appropriate diagnosis. AL is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes, such as CYP2B6, CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, which can be under pharmacogenetic influence. Pharmacogenetics affecting AL metabolism, significantly influence the overall anti-malarial activity leading to variable therapeutic efficacy. This study focused on generic AL drugs used in malarial treatment as prescribed at health facilities and evaluated pharmacogenomic influences on their efficacy. Methods: Patients who have been diagnosed with malaria and confirmed through RDT and microscopy were recruited in this study. Blood samples were taken on days 1, 2, 3 and 7 for parasite count and blood levels of lumefantrine, artemisinin, desbutyl-lumefantrine (DBL), and dihydroartemisinin (DHA), the active metabolites of lumefantrine and artemether, respectively, were analysed using established methods. Pharmacogene variation analysis was undertaken using iPLEX microarray and PCR–RFLP. Results: A total of 52 patients completed the study. Median parasite density from day 1 to 7 ranged from 0–2666/μL of blood, with days 3 and 7 recording 0 parasite density. Highest median plasma concentration for lumefantrine and desbutyl lumefantrine, which are the long-acting components of artemisinin-based combinations, was 4123.75 ng/mL and 35.87 ng/mL, respectively. Day 7 plasma lumefantrine concentration across all generic ACT brands was ≥ 200 ng/mL which potentially accounted for the parasitaemia profile observed. Monomorphism was observed for CYP3A4 variants, while there were observed variations in CYP2B6 and CYP3A5 alleles. Among the CYP3A5 genotypes, significant differences in genotypes and plasma concentration for DBL were seen on day 3 between 1/*1 versus *1/*6 (p = 0.002), *1/*3 versus *1/*6 (p = 0.006) and *1/*7 versus *1/*6 (p = 0.008). Day 7 plasma DBL concentrations showed a significant difference between *1/*6 and *1/*3 (p = 0.026) expressors. Conclusions: The study findings show that CYP2B6 and CYP3A5 pharmacogenetic variations may lead to higher plasma exposure of AL metabolites.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",53,2024

However, our understanding of compound drought-wildfire events, including the hotspots, spatiotemporal patterns, trends, and their impacts on global vegetation growth, remains unclear. Utilizing satellite data on terrestrial water storage, burned areas, and gross primary production (GPP) from 2002 to 2020, we identified a positive correlation between droughts and wildfires and mapped the global patterns of compound drought-wildfire events. Approximately 38.6% of vegetated areas across the globe witnessed rise in probability of compound drought-wildfire events (< 0.016 events/10a). This increasing trend is spatially asymmetric, and greater amplification is observed across the Northern hemisphere due to frequent droughts. Furthermore, the GPP reductions induced by compound drought-wildfire events are more than twice as high as that caused by isolated droughts. These findings identify hotspots for compound drought-wildfire events and offer quantitative evidence of their greater impacts on ecosystems, aiding in the assessment of compound event risks and the implementation of future climate actions.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",79,2024

However, there are limited studies on the feasibility of ddPCR-MRD monitoring after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), especially targeting multiple molecular markers simultaneously. Methods: Our study collected samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in complete remission after allo-HSCT between January 2018 and August 2021 to evaluate whether posttransplant ddPCR-MRD monitoring can identify patients at high risk of relapse. Results: Of 152 patients, 58 (38.2%) were MRD positive by ddPCR within 4 months posttransplant, with a median variant allele frequency of 0.198%. The detectable DTA mutations (DNMT3A, TET2, and ASXL1 mutations) after allo-HSCT were not associated with an increased risk of relapse. After excluding DTA mutations, patients with ddPCR-MRD positivity had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR, 38.7% vs. 9.7%, P < 0.001) and lower rates of relapse-free survival (RFS, 55.5% vs. 83.7%, P < 0.001) and overall survival (OS, 60.5% vs. 90.5%, P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, ddPCR-MRD positivity of non-DTA genes was an independent adverse predictor for CIR (hazard ratio [HR], 4.02; P < 0.001), RFS (HR, 2.92; P = 0.002) and OS (HR, 3.12; P = 0.007). Moreover, the combination of ddPCR with multiparameter flow cytometry (MFC) can further accurately identify patients at high risk of relapse (F+/M+, HR, 22.44; P < 0.001, F+/M-, HR, 12.46; P < 0.001 and F-/M+, HR, 4.51; P = 0.003). Conclusion: ddPCR-MRD is a feasible approach to predict relapse after allo-HSCT in AML/MDS patients with non-DTA genes and is more accurate when combined with MFC.

Our first principles calculation suggests that such DW formation in hafnium zirconium oxide (HZO) based FEs depends on the unique attributes of the HZO unit cell, such as polar-spacer segmentation. Cross pattern of the polar and spacer segments in two neighboring domains along the polarization direction (where polar segment of one domain aligns with the spacer segment of another) boosts the stability of such DWs. We further show that low density of oxygen vacancies at the metal-HZO interface and high work function of metal electrodes are conducive for T–T DW formation. On the other hand, high density of oxygen vacancy and low work function of metal electrode favor H–H DW formation. Polarization bound charges at the DW get screened when band bending from depolarization field accumulates holes (electrons) in T–T (H–H) DW. For a comprehensive understanding, we also investigate their FE nature and domain growth mechanism. Our analysis suggests that a minimum thickness criterion of domains has to be satisfied for the stability of H–H/T–T DW and switching of the domains through such DW formation.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",45,2024

This so-called proteinaceous glue is exocytosed into the centrally located lumen, and subsequently expectorated, serving as an adhesive to attach the puparial case to a solid substrate during metamorphosis. Although this was first described almost 70 years ago, a detailed description of the morphology and mechanical properties of the glue is largely missing. Its main known physical property is that it is released as a watery liquid that quickly hardens into a solid cement. Here, we provide a detailed morphological and topological analysis of the solidified glue. We demonstrated that it forms a distinctive enamel-like plaque that is composed of a central fingerprint surrounded by a cascade of laterally layered terraces. The solidifying glue rapidly produces crystals of KCl on these alluvial-like terraces. Since the properties of the glue affect the adhesion of the puparium to its substrate, and so can influence the success of metamorphosis, we evaluated over 80 different materials for their ability to adhere to the glue to determine which properties favor strong adhesion. We found that the alkaline Sgs-glue adheres strongly to wettable and positively charged surfaces but not to neutral or negatively charged and hydrophobic surfaces. Puparia formed on unfavored materials can be removed easily without leaving fingerprints or cascading terraces. For successful adhesion of the Sgs-glue, the material surface must display a specific type of triboelectric charge. Interestingly, the expectorated glue can move upwards against gravity on the surface of freshly formed puparia via specific, unique and novel anatomical structures present in the puparial’s lateral abdominal segments that we have named bidentia.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",156,2024

Although we previously showed that histidine ammonia lyase (HAL) was transcriptionally reduced by the β-catenin/TCF complex in liver cancer cells, the mechanism(s) of its down-regulation by the complex remain to be clarified. In this study, we search for the transcription factor(s) regulating HAL, and identify CEBPA and FOXA1, two factors whose expression is suppressed by the knockdown of β-catenin or TCF7L2. In addition, RNA-seq analysis coupled with genome-wide mapping of CEBPA- and FOXA1-binding regions reveals that these two factors also increase the expression of arginase 1 (ARG1) that catalyzes the hydrolysis of arginine. Metabolome analysis discloses that activated Wnt signaling augments intracellular concentrations of histidine and arginine, and that the signal also increases the level of lactic acid suggesting the induction of the Warburg effect in liver cancer cells. Further analysis reveals that the levels of metabolites of the urea cycle and genes coding its related enzymes are also modulated by the Wnt signaling. These findings shed light on the altered cellular metabolism in the liver by the Wnt/β-catenin pathway through the suppression of liver-enriched transcription factors including CEBPA and FOXA1.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",58,2024

A shortage of specialist nephrology services plus no consistent criteria for referral and reporting leads to referral pattern variability in the management of individuals with chronic kidney disease. Objective: The objective of this review was to explore the referral patterns of individuals with chronic kidney disease from primary care to specialist nephrology services. It focused on the primary-specialist care interface, optimal timing of referral to nephrology services, adequacy of preparation for kidney replacement therapy, and the role of clinical criteria vs. risk-based prediction tools in guiding the referral process. Methods: A narrative review was utilised to summarise the literature, with the intent of providing a broad-based understanding of the referral patterns for patients with chronic kidney disease in order to guide clinical practice decisions. The review identified original English language qualitative, quantitative, or mixed methods publications as well as systematic reviews and meta-analyses available in PubMed and Google Scholar from their inception to 24 March 2023. Results: Thirteen papers met the criteria for detailed review. We grouped the findings into three main themes: (1) Outcomes of the timing of referral to nephrology services, (2) Adequacy of preparation for kidney replacement therapy, and (3) Comparison of clinical criteria vs. risk-based prediction tools. The review demonstrated that regardless of the time frame used to define early vs. late referral in relation to the start of kidney replacement therapy, better outcomes are evidenced in patients referred early. Conclusions: This review informs the patterns and timing of referral for pre-dialysis specialist care to mitigate adverse outcomes for individuals with chronic kidney disease requiring dialysis. Enhancing current risk prediction equations will enable primary care clinicians to accurately predict the risk of clinically important outcomes and provide much-needed guidance on the timing of referral between primary care and specialist nephrology services.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",98,2024

Herein, natural cellulose is used as the raw material to design a series of cellulose derivatives for perovskite crystallization engineering. The cationic cellulose derivative C-Im-CN with cyano-imidazolium (Im-CN) cation and chloride anion prominently promotes the crystallization process, grain growth, and directional orientation of perovskite. Meanwhile, excess PbI2 is transferred to the surface of perovskite grains or formed plate-like crystallites in local domains. These effects result in suppressing defect formation, decreasing grain boundaries, enhancing carrier extraction, inhibiting non-radiative recombination, and dramatically prolonging carrier lifetimes. Thus, the PSCs exhibit a high power conversion efficiency of 24.71%. Moreover, C-Im-CN has multiple interaction sites and polymer skeleton, so the unencapsulated PSCs maintain above 91.3% of their initial efficiencies after 3000 h of continuous operation in a conventional air atmosphere and have good stability under high humidity conditions.

The objective of this study was to assess the utility of measuring FeNO levels in patients with NTM-PD complicated by asthma. Methods: In this single-center retrospective cohort study, 140 NTM-PD patients with FeNO measured were enrolled. We selected NTM-PD patients who complicated with asthma as the NTM+BA group, defined using the following criteria: NTM patients with symptoms consistent with asthma, and NTM patients with symptomatic improvement after diagnostic therapy with ICS ± a long-acting beta 2-agonist (LABA). We then calculated a diagnostic cutoff point to distinguish between the NTM+BA groups and the NTM groups (all others). High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) images were evaluated using the CT scoring system and their association with FeNO was examined. Results: A total of 89 patients were included in the study.

Compared with the NTM group, the NTM+BA group had higher rates of allergic disease (51.6% vs. 22.4%; p=0.0085) and higher FeNO values (median, 23 [interquartile range {IQR}, 15.0-43.0] ppb vs. median, 17 [IQR, 11.8-23.0] ppb; p=0.015). With diagnostic asthma care using mainly ICS/LABA with reference to the FeNO, most patients (91.0%, 20/22) in the NTM-preceding subgroup in the NTM+BA group demonstrated a prompt improvement of their symptoms and AFB culture findings did not worsen (Culture positive rate (%): Pre-treatment: 59.1% vs. Post-treatment: 40.9%, p=0.3660) at 6 months after starting diagnostic therapy. The optimal diagnostic cutoff point of FeNO to distinguish between the two groups was calculated as 21.5 ppb by the ROC curve (sensitivity 75%, specificity 71.93%, p<0.0001; area under the curve: 0.7989). No significant correlation was observed between FeNO and the severity of CT images in the patients. Conclusions: A certain number of patients with NTM-PD showed exacerbated respiratory symptoms due to asthmatic complications.

While 3D printing technology can efficiently and accurately manufacture customized complex structures, it faces limitations due to inadequate blood supply, which hampers the stability of nipple-shaped cartilage grafts produced using this technology. To address this issue, we employed a biodegradable biomaterial, Poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), loaded with Cell-Free Fat Extract (Ceffe). Ceffe has demonstrated the ability to promote angiogenesis and cell proliferation, making it an ideal bio-ink for bioprinting precise nipple-shaped cartilage grafts. We utilized the Ceffe/PLGA scaffold to create a porous structure with a precise nipple shape. This scaffold exhibited favorable porosity and pore size, ensuring stable shape maintenance and satisfactory biomechanical properties. Importantly, it could release Ceffe in a sustained manner. Our in vitro results confirmed the scaffold’s good biocompatibility and its ability to promote angiogenesis, as evidenced by supporting chondrocyte proliferation and endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Furthermore, after 8 weeks of in vivo culture, the Ceffe/PLGA scaffold seeded with chondrocytes regenerated into a cartilage support structure with a precise nipple shape. Compared to the pure PLGA group, the Ceffe/PLGA scaffold showed remarkable vascular formation, highlighting the beneficial effects of Ceffe. These findings suggest that our designed Ceffe/PLGA scaffold with a nipple shape represents a promising strategy for precise nipple-shaped cartilage regeneration, laying a foundation for subsequent nipple reconstruction.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",39,2024

Annual maximum pack persistence probability was uniformly high (0.95–1.00), and annual minimum pack persistence probability ranged from 0.86–0.98 with a possible decline during years of harvest. Reproduction was similar in years following harvest and agency removal (2013–2015, pup response = 0.27–0.40), and years without harvest or agency removal the year prior (2016–2019, pup response = 0.28–0.66). Pack size had a positive effect on pack persistence and reproduction. Total number of wolf mortalities and number of adult male and females removed did not influence pack persistence or reproduction. We suggest that low per-pack mortality, timing of harvest and agency removal, and harvest characteristics during 2012–2014 supported stable pack persistence and reproduction.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",60,2024

As an essential step in the 3D printing process, postwashing with organic solvents can damage the printed resin polymer and possibly pose a risk to human health. The development of water-washable dental resins means that water can be used as a washing agent. However, the effects of washing agents and washing times on the mechanical and biocompatibility properties of water-washable resins remain unclear. This study investigated the impact of different washing agents (water, detergent, and alcohol) and washing time points (5, 10, 20, and 30 min) on the flexural strength, Vickers hardness, surface characterization, degree of conversion, biocompatibility, and monomer elution of 3D printed samples. Using water for long-term washing better preserved the mechanical properties, caused a smooth surface, and improved the degree of conversion, with 20 min of washing with water achieving the same biological performance as organic solvents. Water is an applicable agent option for washing the 3D printing water-washable temporary crown and bridge resin in the postwashing process. This advancement facilitates the development of other water-washable intraoral resins and the optimization of clinical standard washing guidelines.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",59,2024

Although various strategies have been devised to enhance the Mg2+ migration kinetics and structural stability of cathodes, they fail to improve electronic conductivity, rendering the cathodes incompatible with magnesium-metal anodes. Herein, we propose a dual-defect engineering strategy, namely, the incorporation of Mg2+ pre-intercalation defect (P-Mgd) and oxygen defect (Od), to simultaneously improve the Mg2+ migration kinetics, structural stability, and electronic conductivity of the cathodes of RMMBs. Using lamellar V2O5·nH2O as a demo cathode material, we prepare a cathode comprising Mg0.07V2O5·1.4H2O nanobelts composited with reduced graphene oxide (MVOH/rGO) with P-Mgd and Od. The Od enlarges interlayer spacing, accelerates Mg2+ migration kinetics, and prevents structural collapse, while the P-Mgd stabilizes the lamellar structure and increases electronic conductivity. Consequently, the MVOH/rGO cathode exhibits a high capacity of 197 mAh g−1, and the developed Mg foil//MVOH/rGO full cell demonstrates an incredible lifespan of 850 cycles at 0.1 A g−1, capable of powering a light-emitting diode. The proposed dual-defect engineering strategy provides new insights into developing high-durability, high-capacity cathodes, advancing the practical application of RMMBs, and other new secondary batteries.

Background: Advanced deep learning methods are becoming more crucial in contemporary medical diagnostics, particularly for detecting intricate and uncommon neurological illnesses such as MBD. This rare neurodegenerative disorder, sometimes associated with persistent alcoholism, is characterized by the loss of myelin or tissue death in the corpus callosum. It poses significant diagnostic difficulties owing to its infrequency and the subtle signs it exhibits in its first stages, both clinically and on radiological scans. Methods: The novel method of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) in conjunction with attention mechanisms is used to identify MBD peculiar diseases accurately. VAEs are well-known for their proficiency in unsupervised learning and anomaly detection. They excel at analyzing extensive brain imaging datasets to uncover subtle patterns and abnormalities that traditional diagnostic approaches may overlook, especially those related to specific diseases. The use of attention mechanisms enhances this technique, enabling the model to concentrate on the most crucial elements of the imaging data, similar to the discerning observation of a skilled radiologist. Thus, we utilized the VAE with attention mechanisms in this study to detect MBD. Such a combination enables the prompt identification of MBD and assists in formulating more customized and efficient treatment strategies. Results: A significant breakthrough in this field is the creation of a VAE equipped with attention mechanisms, which has shown outstanding performance by achieving accuracy rates of over 90% in accurately differentiating MBD from other neurodegenerative disorders. Conclusion: This model, which underwent training using a diverse range of MRI images, has shown a notable level of sensitivity and specificity, significantly minimizing the frequency of false positive results and strengthening the confidence and dependability of these sophisticated automated diagnostic tools.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",25,2024

However, the drivers of success in salt marsh planting and their ecological effects are poorly understood at the global scale. Here, we assemble a global database, encompassing 22,074 observations reported in 210 studies, to examine the drivers and impacts of salt marsh planting. We show that, on average, 53% of plantings survived globally, and plant survival and growth can be enhanced by careful design of sites, species selection, and novel planted technologies. Planting enhances shoreline protection, primary productivity, soil carbon storage, biodiversity conservation and fishery production (effect sizes = 0.61, 1.55, 0.21, 0.10 and 1.01, respectively), compared with degraded wetlands. However, the ecosystem services of planted marshes, except for shoreline protection, have not yet fully recovered compared with natural wetlands (effect size = −0.25, 95% CI −0.29, −0.22). Fortunately, the levels of most ecological functions related to climate change mitigation and biodiversity increase with plantation age when compared with natural wetlands, and achieve equivalence to natural wetlands after 5–25 years. Overall, our results suggest that salt marsh planting could be used as a strategy to enhance shoreline protection, biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",77,2024

Apart from inorganic species, water quality suffers also from the occurrence of organic pollutants discharged by the food sector like whey, a by-product of the dairy industry. The valorisation of these organic residues is relevant to reduce water pollution and to develop new materials for different applications. This research reports the synthesis and evaluation of a novel adsorptive activated carbon composite modified with whey protein amyloids for arsenic removal from water. The adsorbent was characterized with FT-IR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, N2 physisorption, pH at point of zero charge determination, and thermogravimetric analysis. Experimental adsorption kinetics and isotherms of arsenic removal were determined at optimal pH 5.0, best fitted with the PSO and Sips model, respectively. The corresponding maximum adsorption capacity for As5+ was 0.16 mmol g−1 through an endothermic process. Surface complexation was the predominant phenomenon in the adsorption mechanism as the As-O bond was formed via whey's functional groups, hydroxyl, amine, and amide, with the latter having the strong affinity to arsenate as elucidated by the HSAB theory. This study highlights the potential of whey protein as a raw material to produce added-value products and its performance as a precursor of novel adsorbents for water purification, therefore minimizing their associated disposal cost and addressing relevant environmental concerns such as arsenic contamination.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",81,2024

Prolonged HUA is often associated with hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. Studies have shown that gut microbiota (GM) affect these chronic diseases. This study aimed to determine the relationship between HUA and GM. The microbiome of 224 men and 254 women aged 40 years was analyzed through next-generation sequencing and machine learning. We obtained GM data through 16S rRNA-based sequencing of the fecal samples, finding that alpha-diversity by Shannon index was significantly low in the HUA group. Linear discriminant effect size analysis detected a high abundance of the genera Collinsella and Faecalibacterium in the HUA and non-HUA groups. Based on light gradient boosting machine learning, we propose that HUA can be predicted with high AUC using four clinical characteristics and the relative abundance of nine bacterial genera, including Collinsella and Dorea. In addition, analysis of causal relationships using a direct linear non-Gaussian acyclic model indicated a positive effect of the relative abundance of the genus Collinsella on blood UA levels.

In the presented work, we show that the major factor determining the clustering structure and consequently also the correlation of resulting clusters with autism severity degree is body mass index corrected for age (BMIFA). After removing the BMIFA effect from the data in two independent ways, both the cluster structure and autism severity correlations disappeared. Despite the fact that the influence of body mass index (BMI) on facial dimensions was studied many times, this is the first time to our knowledge when BMI was incorporated into the faces clustering study and it thereby casts doubt on previous results.

We aimed to evaluate the involvement of immunoglobulins (Igs) and immune complexes (CIC) in the occurrence of AKI in VL patients. Fourteen VL patients were evaluated between early treatment and 12 months post-treatment (mpt). Anti-Leishmania Igs, CIC, cystatin C, C3a and C5a were assessed and correlated with AKI markers. Interestingly, high levels of CIC were observed in VL patients up to 6 mpt. Concomitantly, twelve patients met the criteria for AKI, while high levels of cystatin C were observed up to 6 mpt. Plasmatic cystatin C was positively correlated with CIC and Igs. Moreover, C5a was correlated with cystatin C, CIC and Igs. We did not identify any correlation between amphotericin B use and kidney function markers in VL patients, although this association needs to be further explored in subsequent studies.

However, the effects of high-fat diet (HFD) on these cellular dynamics and their impact on gut integrity remain insufficiently understood. Our study aims to assess the multifaceted interactions between palmitic acid (PA), cell proliferation, and the intestinal epithelial barrier using a canine colonoid model. Canine models, due to their relevance in simulating human intestinal diseases, offer a unique platform to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying HFD derived intestinal dysfunction. Results: Canine colonoids were subjected to PA exposure, a surrogate for the effects of HFD. This intervention revealed a remarkable augmentation of cell proliferative activity. Furthermore, we observed a parallel reduction in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), indicating altered epithelium barrier integrity. While E-cadherin exhibited consistency, ZO-1 displayed a noteworthy reduction in fluorescence intensity within the PA-exposed group. Conclusions: By employing canine intestinal organoid systems, we provide compelling insights into the impact of PA on intestinal physiology. These findings underscore the importance of considering both cell proliferative activity and epithelial integrity in comprehending the repercussions of HFDs on intestinal health.

The reproductive toxicity of NSC319726 was evaluated in male mice following a continuous exposure period of 5 weeks. The result showed that NSC319726 exposure caused testis index reduction, spermatogenesis dysfunction, and architectural damage in the testis and epididymis. The exposure interfered with spermatogonia proliferation, meiosis initiation, sperm count, and sperm morphology. The exposure also disturbed androgen synthesis and blood testis barrier integrity. NSC319726 treatment could elevate the copper ions in the testis to induce cuproptosis in the testis. Copper chelator rescued the elevated copper ions in the testis and partly restored the spermatogenesis dysfunction caused by NSC319726. NSC319726 treatment also decreased the level of retinol dehydrogenase 10 (RDH10), thereby inhibiting the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid, causing the inability to initiate meiosis. Retinoic acid treatment could rescue the meiotic initiation and spermatogenesis while not affecting the intracellular copper ion levels.

The present study aimed to evaluate medication adherence and its associated factors among Chinese patients with PD using a systematic approach and to explore the impact of adequate medication adherence on direct medical costs. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted using the electronic medical records of patients with PD from a medical center in China. Patients with a minimum of two APD prescriptions from January 1, 2016 to August 15, 2018 were included. Medication possession ratio (MPR) and proportion of days covered were used to measure APD adherence. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify factors affecting APD adherence. Gamma regression analysis was used to explore the impact of APD adherence on direct medical costs. Results: In total, 1,712 patients were included in the study, and the mean MPR was 0.68 (± 0.25). Increased number of APDs and all medications, and higher daily levodopa-equivalent doses resulted in higher MPR (mean difference [MD] = 0.04 [0.03–0.05]; MD = 0.02 [0.01–0.03]; MD = 0.03 [0.01–0.04], respectively); combined digestive system diseases, epilepsy, or older age resulted in lower MPR (MD = -0.06 [-0.09 to -0.03]; MD = -0.07 [-0.14 to -0.01]; MD = -0.02 [-0.03 to -0.01], respectively). Higher APD adherence resulted in higher direct medical costs, including APD and other outpatient costs. For a 0.3 increase in MPR, the two costs increased by $34.42 ($25.43–$43.41) and $14.63 ($4.86–$24.39) per year, respectively. Conclusions: APD adherence rate among Chinese patients with PD was moderate and related primarily to age, comorbidities, and healthcare costs.

However, to establish hydrogel-based 3D models in applications such as drug development or personalized medicine, high-throughput culture systems are required. Furthermore, the integration of oxygen-reduced (hypoxic) conditions has become increasingly important to establish more physiologic culture models. Therefore, we developed a platform technology for the high-throughput generation of miniaturized hydrogels for 3D cell culture. The Oli-Up system is based on the shape of a well-plate and allows for the parallel culture of 48 hydrogel samples, each with a volume of 15 µl. As a proof-of-concept, we established a 3D culture of gelatin-methacryloyl (GelMA)-encapsulated mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs). We used a hypoxia reporter cell line to establish a defined oxygen-reduced environment to precisely trigger cellular responses characteristic of hypoxia in MSCs. In detail, the expression of hypoxia response element (HRE) increased dependent on the oxygen concentration and cell density. Furthermore, MSCs displayed an altered glucose metabolism and increased VEGF secretion upon oxygen-reduction. In conclusion, the Oli-Up system is a platform technology for the high-throughput culture of hydrogel-based 3D models in a defined oxygen environment. As it is amenable for automation, it holds the potential for high-throughput screening applications such as drug development and testing in more physiologic 3D in vitro tissue models.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",30,2024

Bacterial leaf streak (BLS), caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) is an important bacterial disease that causes serious threats to rice yield and quality. Transcriptomic profiling provides an effective approach for the comprehensive and large-scale detection of DR genes that participate in the interactions between rice and Xoc. Results: In this study, we used RNA-seq to analyze the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in susceptible rice after inoculation with two naturally pathogenic Xoc strains, a hypervirulent strain, HGA4, and a relatively hypovirulent strain, RS105. First, bacterial growth curve and biomass quantification revealed that differential growth occurred beginning at 1 day post inoculation (dpi) and became more significant at 3 dpi. Additionally, we analyzed the DEGs at 12 h and 3 days post inoculation with two strains, representing the DR genes involved in the PTI and ETI/ETS responses, respectively. Gene Ontology (GO) functional and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed on the common DEGs, which included 4380 upregulated and 4019 downregulated genes and 930 upregulated and 1383 downregulated genes identified for the two strains at 12 h post inoculation (hpi) and 3 dpi, respectively. Compared to those at 12 hpi, at 3 dpi the number of common DEGs decreased, while the degree of differential expression was intensified. In addition, more disease-related GO pathways were enriched, and more transcription activator-like effector (TALE) putative target genes were upregulated in plants inoculated with HGA4 than in those inoculated with RS105 at 3 dpi. Then, four DRs were randomly selected for the BLS resistance assay. We found that CDP3.10, LOC_Os11g03820, and OsDSR2 positively regulated rice resistance to Xoc, while OsSPX3 negatively regulated rice resistance. Conclusions: By using an enrichment method for RNA-seq, we identified a group of DEGs related to the two stages of response to the Xoc strain, which included four functionally identified DR genes.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",49,2024

We aimed to understand the differences in the obstructive patterns, sleep architecture, physical and psychological distress when compared between people living with HIV (PLWH) and matched the severity of SRBDs controls. Methods: A comparative study using matched case-control design was conducted. Men with HIV infection (case group) were enrolled from 2016 to 2019. A control group with HIV seronegative men were matched for SRBDs severity, and were selected from sleep medicine center database for comparison. Results: The mean age of the 108 men (including 54 cases and 54 matched controls) was 33.75 years. Central-apnea index (CI) was higher in the case group rather than matched controls (mean CI, 0.34 vs. 0.17, p = 0.049). PLWH had a lower mean percentage of stage 3 sleep (10.26% vs. 13.94%, p = 0.034) and a higher percentage of rapid eye movement sleep (20.59% vs. 17.85%, p = 0.011) compared to matched controls. Nocturnal enuresis and sleepiness causing traffic accidents were more frequent complaint in PLWH compared to controls. Conclusions: Early detected SRBDs and subtypes in PLWH to begin treatment for the underlying cause could reduce the risk of sleepiness-related traffic accidents.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",31,2024

The deposited layer material commonly presents a significantly refined microstructure, where corrosion could be an issue due to this grain refinement within the layer deposited, possibly creating micro galvanic pairs. The present work investigates the corrosion behavior of the FS deposited material as well as stud base material and substrate using cyclic polarization tests and open circuit potential (OCP) monitoring. Comparing the FS deposited material and the respective consumable stud base material (both AA5083), the grain size is correlated with the results from the corrosion tests, where the deposited material shows more equiaxed and refined grains in comparison to the stud base material. The cyclic potentiostatic polarization tests showed that the stud base material is more resistant to pitting nucleation presenting smaller pits and a lower amount of pits compared to deposited material and substrate. As a complement to OCP test, the stud base material is also more stable on a chloride solution compared to the substrate and the deposited material.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",48,2024

Tongtianyan cave, in Liujiang District of Liuzhou City, southern China is one of the most important fossils finds of H. sapiens, though its age has been debated, with chronometric dates ranging from the late Middle Pleistocene to the early Late Pleistocene. Here we provide new age estimates and revised provenience information for the Liujiang human fossils, which represent one of the most complete fossil skeletons of H. sapiens in China. U-series dating on the human fossils and radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence dating on the fossil-bearing sediments provided ages ranging from ~33,000 to 23,000 years ago (ka).

Previously reported radiosyntheses of [11C]BMP afforded a mixture of 7- and 9-[11C]methyl regioisomers. To prepare for clinical use, we here report an improved regioselective radiosynthesis of [11C]BMP, the results of a non-clinical toxicity study as well as human dosimetry estimates based on mouse PET data. Results: [11C]BMP was synthesised by regioselective N7-methylation of 6-bromo-7H-purine (prepared under good manufacturing practice) with [11C]methyl triflate in presence of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine magnesium chloride in a TRACERlab™ FX2 C synthesis module. [11C]BMP was obtained within a total synthesis time of approximately 43 min in a decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 20.5 ± 5.2%, based on starting [11C]methyl iodide, with a radiochemical purity > 99% and a molar activity at end of synthesis of 197 ± 130 GBq/μmol (n = 28). An extended single-dose toxicity study conducted in male and female Wistar rats under good laboratory practice after single intravenous (i.v.) administration of unlabelled BMP (2 mg/kg body weight) revealed no test item related adverse effects. Human dosimetry estimates, based on dynamic whole-body PET data in female C57BL/6J mice, suggested that an i.v. injected activity amount of 400 MBq of [11C]BMP will deliver an effective dose in the typical range of 11C-labelled radiotracers. Conclusions: [11C]BMP can be produced in sufficient amounts and acceptable quality for clinical use. Data from the non-clinical safety evaluation showed no adverse effects and suggested that the administration of [11C]BMP will be safe and well tolerated in humans.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",32,2024

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of 39 large-volume BPH patients with asymptomatic urethral stricture after urethral stricture surgery who underwent US-LSP from January 2016 to October 2021. Postoperative follow-ups were scheduled at 1, 3, and 6 months. Results: All patients affected by significant BPH-related lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) including 22 cases with asymptomatic anterior urethral stricture and 17 cases with asymptomatic posterior urethral stricture. Median operative time was 118 min (interquartile range [IQR]100–145). Median estimated blood loss was 224 ml (IQR: 190–255). 33 patients(84.6%) avoided continuous bladder irrigation. Postoperative complications occurred in 5 patients (12.8%), including 4 cases with Clavien-Dindo grade 1 and grade 2 and 1 case with grade 3a. During follow-up, US-LSP presented statistically significant improvements in LUTS compared to baseline (P < 0.05). A total of 25 patients had normal ejaculation preoperatively and 3 patients (12%) complained retrograde ejaculation postoperatively. Two patients (5.1%) reported stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and no patient reported aggravated urethral stricture during follow-up. Conclusions: US-LSP was safe and effective in treating large-volume BPH with asymptomatic urethral stricture after urethral stricture surgery.

In this work, we spatially decouple the bromide-mediated process to avoid direct contact between the anode and propylene, where bromine is generated at the anode and then transferred into an independent reactor to react with propylene. This strategy effectively prevents the side reactions and eliminates the interference to stability caused by massive alkene input and vigorously stirred electrolytes. As expected, the selectivity for propylene oxide reaches above 99.9% with a remarkable Faradaic efficiency of 91% and stability of 750-h (>30 days). When the electrode area is scaled up to 25 cm2, 262 g of pure propylene oxide is obtained after 50-h continuous electrolysis at 6.25 A.

However, the emission of free formaldehyde poses a significant challenge for conventional MR. To address the issues of aldehyde in MR, extensive research has been conducted. This paper introduces a novel aldehyde-free MR (LTSL) retanning agent synthesized using cyanuric chloride, l-lysine, and sodium sulfanilate. The chemical structure of LTSL was analyzed via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The presence of amino, carboxyl, and sulfonic acid groups in LTSL enhanced its storability and imparted LTSL with an amphoteric character. The isoelectric point of LTSL was optimized to reach 4.37, and LTSL exhibited an appropriate size distribution with an average particle size of 254.17 nm and achieved high absorption rates of 87.77% and 95.84% for retanning and fatliquoring agents, respectively. Consequently, the thickness rate of LTSL reached up to 37%, with no detectable formaldehyde. Notably, LTSL also demonstrated excellent physical and mechanical properties, primarily attributed to the coordination and electrostatic interactions between the chrome-tanned collagen fiber and amino/carboxyl groups in LTSL. This research presents an innovative approach for developing an aldehyde-free MR retanning agent, significantly contributing to the sustainable development of leather manufacturing.

However, small nanoparticle self-assembly faces numerous challenges in tunability, referring to controlling their structural properties like structure, gaps, and arrangement. These issues highlight the need for further research and development to enhance the tunability and stability of self-assembled small nanoparticles. Here, we report a general centimeter-scale superlattice assembly strategy for noble metal nanoparticles less than 15 nm in size. Not only is this monolayer superlattice assembly generally applicable to different kinds and sizes of noble metal nanoparticles, but also, the crystal plane spacing can also be quickly and conveniently controlled by changing the ethanol concentration. SERS results reveal that optimized superlattice membranes of noble metal nanoparticles possess high detection sensitivity and ordered hot spots. Therefore, our strategy offers prospects for high-performance SERS substrates based on small noble metal nanoparticle superlattices.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",58,2024

In 2023, in the first quarter, 2,744,682 cases were registered, and of these 2,673 patients dieddue to malaria disease. Previous studies have shown that the ABO blood group can affect the progression ofmalaria to severe conditions after P. falciparum infection, while the sickle cell gene offers relative protection. Objective: We investigated changes in the blood count according to blood groups (ABO/Rh) and sickle celltrait in patients with malaria in Luanda, capital of Angola. Methodology: This was a longitudinal, prospectiveand observational study with 198 patients hospitalized for malaria.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether Cisternostomy prevents the occurrence of PTH in patients with moderate and severe TBI. Methods: A retrospective analysis of clinical data of 86 patients with moderate and severe TBI from May 2019 to October 2021 was carried out in the Brain Trauma Center of Tianjin Huanhu Hospital. Univariate analysis was performed to examine the gender, age, preoperative Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, preoperative Rotterdam CT score, decompressive craniectomy rate, intracranial infection rate, the incidence of subdural fluid, and incidence of hydrocephalus in patients between the Cisternostomy group and the non-Cisternostomy surgery group. we also analyzed the clinical outcome indicators like GCS at discharge,6 month GOS-E and GOS-E ≥ 5 in two groups.Additionaly, the preoperative GCS score, decompressive craniectomy rate, age, and gender of patients with PTH and non hydrocephalus were compared. Further multifactorial logistic binary regression was performed to explore the risk factors for PTH. Finally, we conducted ROC curve analysis on the statistically significant results from the univariate regression analysis to predict the ability of each risk factor to cause PTH. Results: The Cisternostomy group had a lower bone flap removal rate(48.39% and 72.73%, p = 0.024)., higer GCS at discharge(11.13 ± 2.42 and 8.93 ± 3.31,p = 0.000) and better 6 month GOS-E(4.55 ± 1.26 and 3.95 ± 1.18, p = 0.029)than the non-Cisternostomy group However, there was no statistical difference in the incidence of hydrocephalus between the two groups (25.81% and 30.91%, p = 0.617). Moreover, between the hydrocephalus group and no hydrocephalus group,there were no significant differences in the incidence of gender, age, intracranial infection, and subdural fluid. While there were statistical differences in peroperative GCS score, Rotterdam CT score, decompressive craniectomy rate, intracranial infection rate, and the incidence of subdural fluid in the two groups, there was no statistical difference in the percentage of cerebral cisterns open drainage between the hydrocephalus group and no hydrocephalus group (32.00% and 37.70%, p = 0.617). Multifactorial logistic binary regression analysis results revealed that the independent risk factors for PTH were intracranial infection (OR = 18.460, 95% CI: 1.864–182.847 p = 0.013) and subdural effusion (OR = 10.557, 95% CI: 2.425–35.275 p = 0.001). Further, The ROC curve analysis showed that peroperative GCS score, Rotterdam CT score and subdural effusion had good ACU(0.785,0.730,and 0.749), with high sensitivity and specificity to predict the occurrence of PTH. Conclusions: Cisternostomy may decrease morbidities associated with removal of the bone flap and improve the clinical outcome, despite it cannot reduce the disability rate in TBI patients.Intracranial infection and subdural fluid were found to be the independent risk factors for PTH in patients with TBI,and the peroperative GCS score, Rotterdam CT score and subdural effusion had higher sensitivity and specificity to predict the occurrence of PTH. And more importantly, no correlation was observed between open drainage of the cerebral cisterns and the occurrence of PTH, indicating that Cisternostomy may not be beneficial in preventing the occurrence of PTH in patients with moderate and severe TBI.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",26,2024

Alarmingly, climate change is accelerating the geographical spreading of CD causative parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi, which additionally increases infection rates. Still, CD treatment remains challenging due to a lack of safe and efficient drugs. In this work, we analyze the viability of T. cruzi Akt-like kinase (TcAkt) as drug target against CD including primary structural and functional information about a parasitic Akt protein. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance derived information in combination with Molecular Dynamics simulations offer detailed insights into structural properties of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of TcAkt and its binding to phosphatidylinositol phosphate ligands (PIP). Experimental data combined with Alpha Fold proposes a model for the mechanism of action of TcAkt involving a PIP-induced disruption of the intramolecular interface between the kinase and the PH domain resulting in an open conformation enabling TcAkt kinase activity. Further docking experiments reveal that TcAkt is recognized by human inhibitors PIT-1 and capivasertib, and TcAkt inhibition by UBMC-4 and UBMC-6 is achieved via binding to TcAkt kinase domain. Our in-depth structural analysis of TcAkt reveals potential sites for drug development against CD, located at activity essential regions.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",132,2024

Versican (VCAN) is a key factor in inflammation through interactions with adhesion molecules. This study constructs a stable panoramic map of mRNA, reveals the possible pathogenesis of bronchiectasis, and provides new ideas and methods for bronchiectasis. Methods: Peripheral blood and tissue gene expression data from patients with bronchiectasis and normal control were selected by bioinformatics analysis. The expression of VCAN in peripheral blood and bronchial tissues of bronchiectasis were obtained by transcriptome sequencing. The protein expression levels of VCAN in serums were verified by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The mRNA expression levels of VCAN in co-culture of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and bronchial epithelial cells were verified by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). In addition, the biological function of VCAN was detected by the transwell assay. Results: The expression of VCAN was upregulated in the bronchiectasis group by sequencing analysis (P < 0.001). The expression of VCAN in the bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B was increased in P. aeruginosa (P.a), which was co-cultured with BEAS-2B cells (P < 0.05). The concentration of VCAN protein in the serum of patients with bronchiectasis was higher than that in the normal control group (P < 0.05). Transwell experiments showed that exogenous VCAN protein induced the migration of neutrophils (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that VCAN may be involved in the development of bronchiectasis by increasing the migration of neutrophils and play an important role in bronchial pathogenesis.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",22,2024

Current treatment options for osteoporosis are limited by factors such as efficacy, cost, availability, side effects, and acceptability to patients. Gold nanoparticles show promise as an emerging osteoporosis therapy due to their osteogenic effects and ability to allow therapeutic delivery but have inherent constraints, such as low specificity and the potential for heavy metal accumulation in the body. This study reports the synthesis of ultrasmall gold particles almost reaching the Ångstrom (Ång) dimension. The antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid (LA) is used as a dispersant and stabilizer to coat Ångstrom-scale gold particles (AuÅPs). Alendronate (AL), an amino-bisphosphonate commonly used in drug therapy for osteoporosis, is conjugated through LA to the surface of AuÅPs, allowing targeted delivery to bone and enhancing antiresorptive therapeutic effects. In this study, alendronate-loaded Ångstrom-scale gold particles (AuÅPs-AL) were used for the first time to promote osteogenesis and alleviate bone loss through regulation of the WNT signaling pathway, as shown through in vitro tests. The in vivo therapeutic effects of AuÅPs-AL were demonstrated in an established osteoporosis mouse model. The results of Micro-computed Tomography, histology, and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining indicated that AuÅPs-AL significantly improved bone density and prevented bone loss, with no evidence of nanoparticle-associated toxicity. These findings suggest the possible future application of AuÅPs-AL in osteoporosis therapy and point to the potential of developing new approaches for treating metabolic bone diseases using Ångstrom-scale gold particles.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",70,2024

Methods: CT scanning and pulmonary function examination were performed for 100 patients with lung cancer. CT volumetric analyses were performed by specific software, for the volume of the inspiratory phase (Vin), the mean inspiratory lung density (MLDin), the volume of expiratory phase (Vex), and the mean lung density at expiratory phase (MLDex). Pulmonary function examination results and CT volumetric analysis results were used to predict postoperative lung function. The concordance and correlations of these values were assessed by Bland-Altman analysis and Pearson correlation analysis, respectively. Multivariate binomial logistic regression analysis was executed to assess the associations of CT data with complication occurrence. Results: Correlations between CT scanning data and pulmonary function examination results were significant in both pre- and post-operation (0.8083 ≤ r ≤ 0.9390). Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), and the ratio of FVC and FEV1 estimated by CT volumetric analyses showed high concordance with those detected by pulmonary function examination. Preoperative (Vin-Vex) and (MLDex- MLDin) values were identified as predictors for post-surgery complications, with hazard ratios of 5.378 and 6.524, respectively. Conclusions: CT volumetric imaging analysis has the potential to determine the pre- and post-operative lung function, as well as to predict post-surgery complication occurrence in lung cancer patients with pulmonary lobectomy.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",19,2024

However, the chloroplast genomes of Dactylicapnos have never been investigated. In this study, chloroplast genomes of seven Dactylicapnos species covering all three sections and one informal group of Dactylicapnos were sequenced and assembled, and the detailed comparative analyses of the chloroplast genome structure were provided for the first time. Results: The results showed that the chloroplast genomes of Dactylicapnos have a typical quadripartite structure with lengths from 172,344 bp to 176,370 bp, encoding a total of 133–140 genes, containing 88–94 protein-coding genes, 8 rRNAs and 37–39 tRNAs. 31 codons were identified as relative synonymous codon usage values greater than one in the chloroplast genome of Dactylicapnos genus based on 80 protein-coding genes. The results of the phylogenetic analysis showed that seven Dactylicapnos species can be divided into three main categories.

A novel injectable polyacrylamide hydrogel (iPAAG) previously demonstrated efficacy and safety up to week 26 in an open-label study of knee OA. Here we report longer-term effectiveness and safety data. Methods: This multi-centre, open-label study included patients with symptomatic and radiographic knee OA. Primary outcome was WOMAC pain (0–100 scale) at 13 weeks, and patients continued to 26 weeks before entering a further 26-week extension phase. Secondary efficacy outcomes included WOMAC stiffness and function subscales, Patient Global Assessment (PGA) and proportion of OMERACT-OARSI responders. Safety outcomes were adverse events (AEs). Results: 49 participants (31 women, mean age 70) received an ultrasound-guided, intra-articular injection of 6 ml iPAAG; 46 completed the extension phase to 52 weeks. There was a significant reduction in the WOMAC pain score from baseline to 52 weeks (− 17.7 points (95% CI − 23.1; − 12.4); p < 0.0001). Similar sustained improvements were observed for WOMAC stiffness (11.0 points; 95% CI − 17.0; − 4.9), physical function (18.0 points; 95% CI − 19.1; − 10.6), and PGA (16.3 points; 95% CI − 23.1; − 9.4).

However, its impact on fungal communities remains unexplored. Therefore, the goal of this study was to examine the effects of mefenoxam on the temporal dynamics of fungal taxonomic and functional diversities during carrot cultivation under four treatment groups: mefenoxam application with and without Pythium inoculation, and untreated control groups with and without Pythium inoculation. Our in vitro sensitivity assay showed that the maximum recommended concentration of mefenoxam, 0.24 ppm, did not suppress the mycelial growth of P. irregulare. At 100 ppm, mycelial growth was only reduced by 11.4%, indicating that the isolate was resistant to mefenoxam. MiSeq sequencing data revealed transient taxonomic variations among treatments 2 weeks post-treatment. Mortierella dominated the fungal community in the mefenoxam-Pythium combination treatment, as confirmed through PCR using our newly designed Mortierella-specific primers. Conversely, mefenoxam-Pythium combination had adverse effects on Penicillium, Trichoderma, and Fusarium, and decrease the overall alpha diversity. However, these compositional changes gradually reverted to those observed in the control by the 12th week. The predicted ecological functions of fungal communities in all Pythium and mefenoxam treatments shifted, leading to a decrease in symbiotrophs and plant pathogen functional groups. Moreover, the community-level physiological profiling approach, utilizing 96-well Biolog FF microplates, showed discernible variations in the utilization of 95 diverse carbon sources among the treatments. Notably, arbutin, l-arabinose, Tween 80, and succinamic acid demonstrated a strong positive association with Mortierella. Our findings demonstrate that a single application of mefenoxam at its recommended rate triggers substantial taxonomic and functional shifts in the soil fungal community. Considering this impact, the conventional agricultural practice of repeated mefenoxam application is likely to exert considerable shifts on the soil ecosystem that may affect agricultural sustainability.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",97,2024

Using observational data and a Linear baroclinic model experiment, our study suggests that the occurrence of hot day is mainly due to anomalous high pressure over East Asia associated with a horizontal stationary wave train originating from a positive phase of the North Atlantic Tripole (NAT) sea surface temperature (SST) in spring. The effect of a positive phase of the NAT SST is evident in the 2000s, apparently associated with the linear trend of the North Atlantic SST like a positive phase of the NAT SST. Before 2000s, in contrast, SST forcing in the Indian Ocean and eastern tropical Pacific, which is associated with a negative phase of the NAT SST, may contribute to induce the East Asian hot days through atmospheric teleconnections. This implies that the relationship between a positive phase of the NAT SST and the occurrence of hot days in East Asia has been changed during the 2000s.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",57,2024

The role of Mediator, a multiprotein complex crucial for RNA polymerase II-driven transcription, has been elucidated in drought stress responses in plants. However, its physiological function and regulatory mechanism in horticultural crop species remain elusive. Results: In this study, we identified a Tail module subunit of Mediator, RhMED15a-like, in rose. Drought stress, as well as treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and abscisic acid (ABA), significantly suppressed the transcript level of RhMED15a-like. Overexpressing RhMED15a-like markedly bolstered the osmotic stress tolerance of Arabidopsis, as evidenced by increased germination rate, root length, and fresh weight. In contrast, the silencing of RhMED15a-like through virus induced gene silencing in rose resulted in elevated malondialdehyde accumulation, exacerbated leaf wilting, reduced survival rate, and downregulated expression of drought-responsive genes during drought stress. Additionally, using RNA-seq, we identified 972 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between tobacco rattle virus (TRV)-RhMED15a-like plants and TRV controls. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that some DEGs were predominantly associated with terms related to the oxidative stress response, such as ‘response to reactive oxygen species’ and ‘peroxisome’. Furthermore, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment highlighted pathways related to ‘plant hormone signal transduction’, in which the majority of DEGs in the jasmonate (JA) and ABA signalling pathways were induced in TRV-RhMED15a-like plants. Conclusion: Our findings underscore the pivotal role of the Mediator subunit RhMED15a-like in the ability of rose to withstand drought stress, probably by controlling the transcript levels of drought-responsive genes and signalling pathway elements of stress-related hormones, providing a solid foundation for future research into the molecular mechanisms underlying drought tolerance in rose.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",81,2024

Our study revealed that HIST3H2A is highly expressed in PCa tissues, as confirmed by analysis of both the GEO and UALCAN databases. Further analysis using the KEGG database demonstrated that HIST3H2A regulates the pathway of programmed necroptosis in cells. Additionally, we observed significant up-regulation of HIST3H2A in PCa tissues and cell lines. HIST3H2A was found to regulate cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in tumors.

However, the specific role and mechanism of cholesterol metabolism on spontaneous and progressive HCC development from the point of view of ferroptosis are still worth exploring. The present study aimed to reveal a novel mechanism of cholesterol metabolism-related ferroptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Methods: Two microarray datasets (GSE25097, GSE22058) related to HCC were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. Metabolomics analysis was performed by ultra performance liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS). The cholesterol-related proteins were downloaded from HMBD. Ferroptosis-related genes were extracted from FerrDb database. Data sets were separated into two groups. GSE25097 was used to identify ferroptosis-related genes, and GSE22058 was used to verify results. During these processes, chemical–protein interaction (CPI), protein–protein interaction (PPI), the Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were conducted. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to test the associated pathway. Results: We identified 8 differentially expressed ferroptosis-related genes (HAMP, PTGS2, IL1B, ALOX15B, CDKN2A, RRM2, NQO1 and KIF20A) and 4 differentially expressed cholesterol-related genes (LCAT, CH25H, CEL and CYP7A1). Furthermore, based on the predicted results with STITCH, we identified indomethacin and IL1B as the essential node for cholesterol-mediated ferroptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cell. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed the activities of plasma IL1B in liver cancer patients enrolled have been significantly affected by the level of plasma cholesterol (P < 0.001) and the test result of IL1B is a predictor variable causing the changes of serum Fe levels (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Our findings shed new light on the association between cholesterol metabolism and ferroptosis in HCC, and suggest that IL1B is the necessary node for cholesterol to lead to ferroptosis process in HCC. Also, we identified the potential role of indomethacin in adjuvant therapy of HCC with complications of abnormal cholesterol metabolism.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",28,2024

Although numerous molecular alterations have been linked to the occurrence and progression of bladder cancer, currently there is a limited knowledge on the molecular signature able of accurately predicting clinical outcomes. In this report, we present a case of a pT3b high-grade infiltrating urothelial carcinoma with areas of squamous differentiation characterized by very high tumor mutational burden (TMB), with up-regulations of immune checkpoints. The high TMB, along with elevated expressions of PD-L1, PD-L2, and PD1, underscores the rationale for developing a personalized immunotherapy focused on the use of immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Additionally, molecular analysis revealed somatic mutations in several other cancer-related genes, including TP53, TP63 and NOTCH3. Mutations of TP53 and TP63 genes provide mechanistic insights on the molecular mechanisms underlying disease development and progression. Notably, the above-mentioned mutations and the elevated hypoxia score make the targeting of p53 and/or hypoxia related pathways a plausible personalized medicine option for this bladder cancer, particularly in combination with immunotherapy.

Ropinirole, a dopamine D2 receptor agonist, has previously shown therapeutic potential for periodontitis but the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Methods: Human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) treated with LPS were considered to mimic periodontitis in vitro. The dosage of Ropinirole was selected through the cell viability of HGFs evaluation. The protective effects of Ropinirole on HGFs were evaluated by detecting cell viability, cell apoptosis, and pro-inflammatory factor levels. The molecular docking between NAT10 and Ropinirole was performed. The interaction relationship between NAT10 and KLF6 was verified by ac4C Acetylated RNA Immunoprecipitation followed by qPCR (acRIP-qPCR) and dual-luciferase reporter assay. Results: Ropinirole alleviates LPS-induced damage of HGFs by promoting cell viability, inhibiting cell apoptosis and the levels of IL-1β, IL-18, and TNF-α. Overexpression of NAT10 weakens the effects of Ropinirole on protecting HGFs. Meanwhile, NAT10-mediated ac4C RNA acetylation promotes KLF6 mRNA stability. Upregulation of KLF6 reversed the effects of NAT10 inhibition on HGFs. Conclusions: Taken together, Ropinirole protected HGFs through inhibiting the NAT10 ac4C RNA acetylation to decrease the KLF6 mRNA stability from LPS injury. The discovery of this pharmacological and molecular mechanism of Ropinirole further strengthens its therapeutic potential for periodontitis.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",28,2024

However, the specific mechanisms of association between these two diseases have not been fully investigated. Materials and methods: In this study, we downloaded IAs and PD data from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, and functional enrichment analysis was performed. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identified key modules and key crosstalk genes. In addition, the immune cell landscape was assessed and the correlation of key crosstalk genes with each immune cell was calculated. Finally, transcription factors (TFs) regulating key crosstalk genes were explored. Results: 127 overlapping DEGs were identified and functional enrichment analysis highlighted the important role of immune reflection in the pathogenesis of IAs and PD. We identified ITGAX and COL4A2 as key crosstalk genes. In addition, the expression of multiple immune cells was significantly elevated in PDs and IAs compared to controls, and both key crosstalk genes were significantly negatively associated with Macrophages M2. Finally, GATA2 was identified as a potential key transcription factor (TF), which regulates two key crosstalk gene. Conclusions: The present study identifies key crosstalk genes and TF in PD and IAs, providing new insights for further study of the co-pathogenesis of PD and IAs from an immune and inflammatory perspective. Also, this is the first study to report the above findings.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",66,2024

Purpose: To assess the causal effect of educational duration on bone mineral density(BMD) and risk factors for OP by Mendelian randomization(MR) study. Methods: The causal relationship was analyzed using data from genome-wide association study(GWAS). Inverse variance weighting (IVW) was used as the main analysis method. Horizontal pleiotropy was identified by MR-Egger intercept test, MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) test. The leave-one-out method was used as a sensitivity analysis. Results: The IVW results indicated that there was a positive causal relationship between educational duration and BMD (OR = 1.012, 95%CI:1.003–1.022), physical activity(PA) (OR = 1.156, 95%CI:1.032–1.295), calcium consumption (OR = 1.004, 95%CI:1.002–1.005), and coffee intake (OR = 1.019, 95%CI:1.014–1.024). There was a negative association between whole body fat mass (OR = 0.950, 95%CI:0.939–0.961), time for vigorous PA (OR = 0.955, 95%CI:0.939–0.972), sunbath (OR = 0.987, 95%CI:0.986–0.989), salt consumption (OR = 0.965, 95%CI:0.959–0.971), fizzy drink intake (OR = 0.985, 95%CI:0.978–0.992), smoking (OR = 0.969, 95%CI:0.964–0.975), and falling risk (OR = 0.976, 95%CI:0.965–0.987). There was no significant association between educational duration and lean mass, time for light-to-moderate PA, milk intake, and alcohol intake. Horizontal pleiotropy was absent in this study. The results were robust under sensitivity analyses. Conclusion: A longer educational duration was causally linked with increased BMD. No causal relationship had been found between educational duration and lean mass, time for light-to-moderate PA, milk intake, and alcohol consumption as risk factors for osteoporosis.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",43,2024

The aims of this study was to explore the mediating role of internet addiction between alexithymia and depression and the moderating role of physical activity. A total of 594 valid responses were included in the analysis, with a mean age of 18.72 years (SD = 1.09). The sample comprised 250 males (42.09%) and 344 females (57.91%). These responses were utilized for descriptive analysis, correlation analysis, regression analysis, and the development of mediation and moderation models. Alexithymia showed positive correlations with depression and internet addiction, and physical activity was negatively correlated with internet addiction and depression. Internet addiction partially mediated the relationship between alexithymia and depression, while physical activity weakened the association between internet addiction and depression, acting as a moderator. Our findings suggest that excessive Internet engagement may mediate the relationship between alexithymia and depression as an emotional regulatory coping strategy, and that physical activity attenuates the predictive effect of Internet addiction on depression.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",79,2024

Chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC) is a progressive degenerative inflammatory condition highly prevalent in Latin America that leads to a disturbance of cardiac conduction system. Despite its clinical and epidemiological importance, CCC molecular pathogenesis is poorly understood. Here we characterize and discriminate the plasma metabolomic profile of 15 patients with advanced HF referred for heart transplantation – 8 patients with CCC and 7 with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) – using gas chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Compared to the 12 heart donor individuals, also included to represent the control (CTRL) scenario, patients with advanced HF exhibited a metabolic imbalance with 21 discriminating metabolites, mostly indicative of accumulation of fatty acids, amino acids and important components of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. CCC vs. IDC analyses revealed a metabolic disparity between conditions, with 12 CCC distinctive metabolites vs. 11 IDC representative metabolites. Disturbances were mainly related to amino acid metabolism profile. Although mitochondrial dysfunction and loss of metabolic flexibility may be a central mechanistic event in advanced HF, metabolic imbalance differs between CCC and IDC populations, possibly explaining the dissimilar clinical course of Chagas’ patients.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",64,2024

Vilm.),Cell Death Discovery,"[('All-Russia Research Institute of Agricultural Biotechnology', 'Moscow', 'Russian Federation')]","© The Author(s) 2024.Programmed cell death (PCD) is relevant to many aspects in the growth and development of a plant organism. In their reproduction, many flowering plant species possess self-incompatibility (SI), that is an intraspecific reproductive barrier, which is a genetic mechanism ensuring the avoidance of inbreeding depression by preventing self-pollination. This phenomenon enhances intraspecific variation; however, SI is rather a hindrance for some fruit plant species (such as plum, cherry, and peer trees) rather than an advantage in farming. PCD is a factor of the S-RNase–based SI in Petunia hybrida E. Vilm. The growth of self-incompatible pollen tubes (PTs) is arrested with an increase in the activity of caspase-like proteases during the first hours after pollination so that all traits of PCD—plasma membrane integrity damage, DNA degradation/disintegration, and damage of PT structural organization (absence of vacuoles, turgor disturbance, and separation of cell plasma membrane from the cell wall)—are observable by the moment of PT growth arrest. We succeeded in discovering an additional cytological PCD marker, namely, the formation of ricinosomes in self-incompatible PTs at early stages of PCD. SI is removable by treating petunia stigmas with Acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-aldehyde (Ac-DEVD-CHO), an inhibitor of caspase-3/DEVDase, 2 h before a self-incompatible pollination. In this process, the level of caspase-3-like protease activity was low, DNA degradation was absent, PTs grew to the ovary, fertilization was successful, and full-fledged seeds were formed.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",65,2024

TB delay, consisting of patient delay, diagnostic delay, treatment delay, increases the risk of adverse anti-TB treatment (ATT) outcomes. Except for individual level variables, differences in regional levels have been shown to impact the ATT outcomes. However, few studies appropriately considered possible individual and regional level confounding variables. In this study, we aimed to assess the association of TB delay on treatment outcomes in HIV-TB co-infected patients in Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture (Liangshan Prefecture) of China, using a causal inference framework while taking into account individual and regional level factors. Methods: We conducted a study to analyze data from 2068 patients with HIV-TB co-infection in Liangshan Prefecture from 2019 to 2022. To address potential confounding bias, we used a causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) to select appropriate confounding variables. Further, we controlled for these confounders through multilevel propensity score and inverse probability weighting (IPW). Results: The successful rate of ATT for patients with HIV-TB co-infection in Liangshan Prefecture was 91.2%. Total delay (OR = 1.411, 95% CI: 1.015, 1.962), diagnostic delay (OR = 1.778, 95% CI: 1.261, 2.508), treatment delay (OR = 1.749, 95% CI: 1.146, 2.668) and health system delay (OR = 1.480 95% CI: (1.035, 2.118) were identified as risk factors for successful ATT outcome. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of these findings. Conclusions: HIV-TB co-infection prevention and control policy in Liangshan Prefecture should prioritize early treatment for diagnosed HIV-TB co-infected patients. It is urgent to improve the health system in Liangshan Prefecture to reduce delays in diagnosis and treatment.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",56,2024
