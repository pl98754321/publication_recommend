Philology literally means love for the word. It is the love for the word that unites philologists with translators, researchers, scientists, and fashion specialists. The translatological analysis of this specialist language is a reduced selection of 200 idioms, illustrative examples from English, Montenegrin or Serbian, and Italian. Also, habitual fashion collocations constitute a significant part of the translatological analysis. I have completed my analysis with contemporary terminology of fashion clothing terms and words in English and their equivalents in Italian, almost 150 of them, compiled in a small glossary. This small glossary will be of great help to fashion and clothing industry professionals. Through their level of engagement, public figures from the world of art, music, fashion and politics, as well-known officials, actors or celebrities, have become the new trend-setters in all societies and also dictators of fashion, because they set the trends and fashion standards which others follow.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",18,2018

The framework revisits the Quantity, Informativeness, and Manner (Q, I and M) heuristics of communication by Levinson (1995, 2000). Three interpretation principles are suggested (I-Q, I-I and I-M) (I for interpretation). The principles are applied to the main parts of the message (vocabulary, connectives, and marked forms) following Johns (2014). The I-Q principle advises interpreters to select the words that are most consistent with the speaker’s best knowledge of the world and to communicate them as such; the I-I principle advises interpreters to simply and systematically notate the connectives that exemplify a similar connection to the SM; the I-M principle advocates that interpreters should mark any instances of marked forms such as over-lexicalization, prolixity, and repetition, and relay them with a similar level of markedness to communicate a similar attitude of the SM speaker in the TL.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",17,2018

For large n, the geometric distribution is well-approximated by the exponential distribution. The number of twin primes less or equal to x will then follow the Poisson distribution with the same rate parameter as the exponential distribution.

All rights reserved.In this paper, I aim to show that the critical appropriation of political power can be a potential tool in transforming political structures into just institutions. To achieve this aim, I employ Ricoeur’s hermeneutics of symbols because in his different political essays, he con-sistently regards political power as akin to a symbol. Thus, for him, the critical appropriation of political power requires a hermeneutical procedure. And so in my discussion, I devote one section for Ricoeur’s hermeneutics of symbols, one for his thoughts on political power, and another one for the critical appropriation of political power through the hermeneutics of symbols. To put Ricoeur’s political and hermeneutical thoughts in a better light, I introduce these sections with a separate section on his philosophical anthropology. In my conclusion, I affirm that transforming political structures into just institutions is very much possible through the critical appropriation of political power. It is such a potential tool in effecting these transformations because the critical appropriation of political power involves a hermeneutical procedure that follows a three-step process of reflection. And reflection, which makes way for the critical appropriation of political power, is what ensures that power rests only in the hands of those who are more likely to advance the common good, resulting into a greater possibility for the transformation of political structures into just institutions.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",38,2018

All rights reserved.Recognizing the human dimension on participation to environmental conservation initiatives, this study determined the socio-economic characteristics of stakeholders in Bataan Coastal Resource Management (CRM) and how these variables influence their participation in the process. Data were collected through a survey. Four variables revealed to be independent indicators of high or poor CRM participation: the stakeholders’ locality income class, age, level of education, and household size. These indicators are important matters to cogitate for they are indirect drivers of the success or failure of CRM activities. It is concluded that Bataan CRM in the Philippines needs to be reviewed to tackle socio-economic barriers to engagement. Assessment of the process of selecting Bataan CRM participants; strength-ened information, education, and communication component through an enriched content and rationalized delivery; institution of a unified CRM database system; and establishment of a provincial CRM research center are all recommended to counteract stakeholder es-trangement and unresponsiveness to CRM efforts.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2018

All rights reserved.Energy conservation is a buzzword that cuts across a broad spectrum of stakeholders. It has been widely practiced, developed, and discussed in government, political, and industrial sectors due to its massive impact on tackling issues related to climate change and global warming as well as presenting opportunities to cut energy costs. Despite the active discussion of this topic in the literature, very few papers have discussed it in the context of academic institutions which has one of the most significant impacts in terms of energy consumption. To address the issue, this paper places the topic of energy conservation in the context of academic institutions. Moreover, it adopts the Theory of Planned Behavior to investigate the success of energy conservation initiatives in academic institutions by looking at user behavior and its antecedents. Finally, this paper contributes significantly to the literature as it is one of the very few papers and arguably the first to discuss energy conservation in the context of academic institutions using the Theory of Planned Behavior. Furthermore, this paper will be beneficial for practitioners and other stakeholders in that it provides them with a framework to investigate the success of implementing energy conservation initiatives, especially, in academic institutions by looking at the antecedents of user behavior.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",17,2018

Across languages, the perfect is still attested as one of the central verb forms acquiring meanings of information source. This paper investigates the development of the perfect meaning into evidential meanings from two vantage points: firstly, cross-linguistically, and, secondly, in the North-Tungusic language Even. The perfect meaning typically evolves into the evidential meaning of inference, a development which has been documented in two of the three main dialects of Even by Malchukov (2000). Inference is accompanied by a mirative interpretation in first-person contexts; the current study shows that this interpretation extends to second person. As is cross-linguistically common, in Even inference has evolved to a non-witnessed meaning. By losing its perfect “nature”, this use has crossed over to the domain of discourse to signal a narrative genre by functioning as a narrative tense.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",77,2018

While proportionality makes sense in theory, it may be difficult to implement in practice, due to the inherent conflict between individual rights and the common good underlying the principle. To apply the proportionality principle to a decision of policy, one must still find a reasonable way of balancing these competing values in light of the available options and empirical evidence. In this article, I consider how the proportionality principle applies to the regulation of dietary supplements and examine some critiques of the current oversight system. I argue that it may be difficult maintain proportional oversight because the risks of dietary supplements vary considerably. Strengthening the regulations may therefore promote an appropriate level of regulation in some cases but lead to overregulation in others.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",77,2018

From a constructional perspective, it is proposed that the noncanonical V-NP structure has gone through a process of grammatical constructionalization and constructional change (Traugott & Trousdale 2013), which involves diachronic changes in productivity, schematicity and compositionality and which is manifested in the increasing number of the semantic types of postverbal NPs.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",52,2018

This rise has coincided with increased consciousness of ethical issues pertaining to food, particularly as they concern animals. We rank cookbooks by celebrity chefs according to the minimum number of sentient animals that must be killed to make their recipes. On our stipulative definition, celebrity chefs are those with their own television show on a national network in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada or Australia. Thirty cookbooks by 26 such chefs were categorized according to the total number of cows, pigs, chicken, fish and other species they included as ingredients. The total number of animals killed was divided by the number of non-dessert recipes to generate an average number of animal deaths per recipe for each book. We outline the rationale for our project and its methodology before presenting a ranked table of 30 cookbooks by celebrity chefs. This method generates several interesting findings. The first concerns the wide variation in animal fatalities among cookbooks. The chef with the heaviest animal footprint killed 5.25 animals per recipe, while the omnivorous chef with the smallest footprints killed 0.19 per recipe. Clearly, not all approaches to meat eating are equal when it comes to their animal mortality rate. Pigs and large ruminants are all substantially bigger than poultry, which are themselves bigger than many fish. The prime determinant of a chef’s place in the index was the number of small animals his or her recipes required. Whether a chef cooked in the style of a particular cuisine (Italian, French, Mexican etc.), by contrast, had no discernible influence on his or her ranking. We analyze how different chefs present themselves—as either especially sensitive or insensitive to ethical issues involving animals and food—and note cases where these presentations do or do not match their index ranking.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",113,2018

With the exception of Lawrence Venuti’s The Scandals of Translation (1998), few scholars have ventured in-depth studies of the subject. The study I propose is two-fold, with individual focuses on the theory and practice of translation, each analysed from three distinct perspectives: the translator’s visibility, culpability and conscience. This dual focus combined with its varying angles of analysis will lead to relatively well-defined conclusions. The theoretical element of this study is based upon scholarly opinion regarding existing constraints on the translator’s task (Lefevere; Bassnett; Lambert), and the direct influence of those constraints upon the literary translator’s process and final result. With the purpose of illustrating these theoretical suppositions, this essay analyses a recent translation (2013) of a political essay originally written in English and later published in translation in a Spanish newspaper. The detailed theoretical and practical analyses of this text will reveal the translator’s performance in the case of study as well as answer the following questions: Is the translator visible? If so, why did she choose to be? Is the translator culpable or innocent in the final results of the translation? Lastly, did the translator make the decisions in question consciously or unconsciously? The ultimate objective of this essay is to provide answers to these questions, thus not only clarifying the translator’s performance in this specific case but also demonstrating a translator’s ethic in more general terms. And, perhaps, it can also begin the elaboration of a much-needed ethical code for translators.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",10,2018

The results show that MoC significantly differs from OC both in the preference of lexicalization patterns (Talmyan typology) and semantic components distributed in discourse (Slobinian typology) when narrating similar motion scenes. However, these results fail to support the viewpoint that Chinese has undergone a change from a verb- to a satellite-frame (Li 1993; Talmy 2000; Peyraube 2006; Shi & Wu 2014). It is argued that (i) the Talmyan typology and the Slobinian typology should be treated separately. In Talmyan typology, the diachrony of Chinese demonstrates the change of a V- to a parallel-frame, in that satellite- and verb-framed constructions in MoC have equal frequency and show no bias for the encoding of subtypes of autonomous motion. In Slobinian typology, MoC remains as a Path-salient language, as it gives considerable weight to the expression of Path; (ii) the dominant lexicalization pattern in a language varies from one sub-domain of motion to another (see also Lamarre 2003), and thus the typology of motion expressions is sub-domain-specific; and (iii) motivating forces and blocking forces, furthermore, co-exist diachronically for the typological evolution of motion encoding due to the idiosyncrasy of the morphosyntactic system.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",41,2018

All rights reserved.Social enterprise (SE) is a hybrid organisation, which combine two different goals in their mission and vision. In an attempt to sustain their operation, a social enterprise must ensure that both missions (social and financial) is equally balanced and achievable. The existence of SE is to fill the gap leave behind by traditional profit organisation, non-profit organisations (NPOs) and the government. The aim is to positively impact the social, cultural and environmental issues through their unique business model. Their uniqueness, while can benefit the community and society as a whole is prone to fraud and misuse of funds which would eventually affect the survival of SE. The issues are originated from weak governance particularly the structure of their organisations. Hence, this study aims to examine the relationship between the organisational structure, financial performance and social value of SE in Malaysia. On the other hand, the study also aim to examine the mediating role of financial performance on the relationship between organisational structure and social value. Organisational structure is vital as carefully selected, well designed and well managed organisational structure will improve the impact of social enterprise on the society. This study is based on the 134 data obtained from the SE in Malaysia and registered as Company Limited by Guarantee (CLBG). The selection of a sample of respondents was done using purposive sampling method. Based on multiple regression analysis, the study found that organisational structure and financial performance significantly influence the social value of SE.

The second person singular, the third person plural and the ‘man’- and ‘one’-pronouns are studied by means of an acceptability judgment questionnaire and a completion questionnaire. The combination of the two methods reveals interesting descriptive facts about the three West Germanic languages. They include, among other things, the ‘man’-prominence of Afrikaans versus the ‘you’-prominence of Dutch and English for expressing the universal meaning ‘anyone’ and the more prominent position of ‘they’ in Dutch than in the other languages for conveying the existential meaning ‘someone, some people’. Our findings have a number of more theoretical implications too. The two existing semantic maps for human impersonal pronouns make different distinctions in the existential domain, based on type/level of (un)knownness on the one hand and number on the other. Our study tests both sets of distinctions and shows that the two dimensions interact with each other in Afrikaans, Dutch and English. The results thus support a recent proposal in the literature for a combined semantic map. The data from the completion questionnaire, finally, also indicates that existential uses prefer alternative forms of impersonalization to human impersonal pronouns in all three languages.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",35,2018

The same dynamics undermine local resilience, understood as the capacity to adapt and develop in response to changes, persistent social and ecological risks, and disasters. Water and sanitation challenges undermine resilience by causing and compounding risks to individuals, and to household and community health and livelihoods, in a complex context in which communities and local governments have limited capacity and resources to respond appropriately. Household and community resilience in informal settlements is drawing increasing policy focus, given the persistence of these kinds of neighbourhoods in cities and towns in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Africa, in particular.

Captive breeding has prevented extinction of this species, but successful reintroduction of ferrets into their native grassland habitat is a complex endeavor. As specialist predators, ferrets depend almost exclusively on prairie dogs (Cynomys spp.) for both food and shelter, so successful black-footed ferret reintroduction hinges on maintaining large colonies of prairie dogs. However, prairie dogs are also considered agricultural pests and are often subjected to eradication programs. These eradication programs hamper efforts to reintroduce ferrets and disrupt the valuable ecosystem services prairie dogs provide in their role as both keystone and foundation species. Even when agreements are reached to maintain prairie dog colonies, plague (Yersinia pestis), which infects both prairie dogs and ferrets, can threaten the success of a ferret reintroduction program.

High demand for Indonesian timber and plantation development has driven large-scale draining and clearing of peat forest, resulting in extensive fires and smoke haze problems across the region. These fires caused more than 100,000 premature deaths in 2015 alone, increased the pressure on several already threatened species, and placed Indonesia among the top greenhouse gas emitting countries globally. In response, the Indonesian government has launched an initiative to restore more than 2 million ha of peatland between now and 2020. Although there is a substantial body of academic literature that deals with technical aspects of tropical peatland restoration, little is published on the costs of tropical peatland restoration activities. In this study, we examine the case of peatland restoration in the provinces of Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Papua in Indonesia, and propose a restoration activity classification scheme based on fire, drainage, and logging history of peatland areas. We use this scheme to identify the restoration activity needs of different areas and then develop a preliminary gross financial cost estimate for the restoration activities proposed under the national 2-million-ha peatland restoration initiative. We find that it is likely to cost more than US$4.6 billion to complete the national 2-million-ha restoration initiative, which is substantially more than the funds currently allocated to the challenge across Indonesian and international donor budgets.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",32,2018

The oxygen depletion crisis,Case Studies in the Environment,"[('American Institute of Physics', 'College Park', 'United States')]","© 2018 by the Regents of the University of California.Scientists can be important public advocates in environmental issues. But scientific activism can take different forms, and deciding when and how to become an activist can be difficult for people who are trained to understand science as the objective pursuit of truth. This case study explores these issues through the history of the Oxygen Depletion Crisis. Between 1966 and 1970, it appeared that the global oxygen supply might be endangered by pesticides, industrial pollution, or the ongoing combustion of fossil fuels. The science was uncertain, but the potential threat was considerable. One response came from geophysicists Lloyd Berkner and Lauriston Marshall, who quietly initiated a research program and refrained from speaking publicly until the full scope of the crisis was better understood, in a conscious effort to avoid provoking public concern. We label this approach “public reticence.” Ecologist LaMont Cole instead made oxygen depletion a prominent talking point in his Congressional testimony and presentations across the country, so successfully stimulating the public concern that oxygen depletion became one of the multiple environmental anxieties motivating mass action on Earth Day in 1970. While the oxygen depletion crisis had a relatively clear scientific resolution, its legacy for environmental policy is interestingly complicated. This case uses historical perspective to help students to debate on scientific activism, an issue especially relevant today in light of climate change and events like the March for Science on Earth Day, 2017.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",44,2018

The incident resulted in the largest fine for an environmental infraction in Alberta history up to that time. Despite the incident, the province of Alberta has continued to subsidize the facility and has kept it in operation, with changes in management. The policy rationale is that if the facility were not available, accumulation and possible diversion of hazardous waste into illegal disposal alternatives would threaten the environment much more than operation of the plant.

Incidents in which people are exposed to toxic substances do not occur in a social vacuum. Risk management strategies must be adapted to groups with different cultural values and expectations. Community and individual responses to such incidents, and the development of health advisory messages, may depend on presenting information on exposure and risk in terms consistent with cultural patterns among subpopulations in the community.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",6,2018

Al Allen, the University's Vice President of Facilities Management, was the point person entrusted with not only completing the project on time and on budget but also ensuring that the building received external certification that validated its sustainability standards. Allen's task was not an easy one because he had to address the often-conflicting demands of the project's stakeholders, many of whom, although well meaning, had no knowledge of how the building's architectural details related to sustainability. Freeman's [1] idea of stakeholders affecting an organization's actions come into play in this case. This paper examines Allen's path as the project leader and the choices that he confronts via the lens of stakeholder theory as it impacts a sustainability initiative. As a result of engaging in the analysis of this case, the reader should have a fine-grained perspective on how organizations confront the trade-offs between the financial and the sustainability sides of a decision, particularly when these sides may not be completely convergent.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",21,2018

While many studies have been conducted to investigate the determinants of consumers’ intention to use online shopping, mixed results are always found, especially when businesses take unique approaches for their digital presence. Besides, even though self-efficacy has been studied extensively in information system research, technological complexity has always given a challenge to consumers’ computing ability. Building on the Use and Gratification Theory (GTA) and the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), this study aims to examine the relationships between entertainment gratification, informative gratification, web irritation and self-efficacy towards individual’s intention to use online shopping. Using the quantitative survey approach, data was collected from 217 young executives who are frequent online shoppers. The results of the structural equation modelling suggest entertainment gratification, informative gratification and self-efficacy as factors that derive consumers’ intention to shop online. On the other hand, web irritation has no significant relationship with online shopping intention. The findings do not only capture the importance for web retailers to provide adequate buying-selling information and to provide the element of fun in the shopping portals, but it also suggests that web retailers provide less complicated online shopping features since consumers’ ability to use the technology determines purchase behaviour.

The work consists of two parts. In the first part, a critical analysis of four recently proposed theories of social development, focusing on geographical, institutional or cultural factors, is given. These theories have greatly enriched our understanding of the evolution of society, however, as analysis shows, none of them provides a satisfactory description of the driving forces and mechanisms of this evolution; the main reason is rooted in their common deficiency - monocausality. It is proposed to distinguish between two types of development, catching up and leading. The basic ideas of the theory of catching up development are presented. This approach makes it possible to explain the phenomenon of the ""economic miracle""as a result of mutually conditioned changes in culture, institutions, technological progress and well-being in the context of interaction of competition, power and collaboration mechanisms. The second part is devoted to the theory of leading socioeconomic development. It is shown how in Western Europe, as a result of the interaction of the above four factors, specific forms and combinations of the three main mechanisms of coordination - competition, power and collaboration - emerged at each stage of evolution. I emphasize the importance of ideology and the phenomenon of technical progress in the formation of institutions of economic and political competition that contributed to the creation of the welfare state. These changes and economic growth created the conditions for further transformation of civil culture: increasing levels of trust, tolerance, altruism and cosmopolitanism, expanding the planning horizon. The decrease in the level of coercion built into the mechanisms of power and competition are demonstrated as well as the expansion of the role of collaboration. A hypothesis is advanced that the speed of this process depends on geographical factors. The idea of the welfare world is discussed.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",78,2018

The Role of Social Vulnerability in Post-Disaster Recovery after Floods in Germany,Raumforschung und Raumordnung,"[('Technische Hochschule Nürnberg', 'Nurnberg', 'Germany')]","© Der/die Autor(en) 2018.Environmental and climate hazards, such as floods, increasingly cause damages in cities and urbanised areas in Germany. The capacity of the impacted populations to cope with the outcome of related disasters is, amongst others, influenced by their vulnerability. Vulnerability reduction is thus key for creating social or structural resilience. This is particularly the case during post-disaster recovery and reconstruction. Recovery planning is, per definition, supposed to enable improvement, rather than a reconstruction of the status quo. However, which role does vulnerability play in recovery projects, and what kind of a recovery can improved planning lead to as a result? Based on a case study of the flood disaster of the river Danube in 2013, and particularly the Bavarian city of Deggendorf, we investigate these questions. From 2013 to 2018, data was collected by means of a survey, a spatial analysis and qualitative interviews. The results show how particular social vulnerabilities strongly influence the individual access to resources required during recovery and reconstruction as well as the capacity to deal with long-term disaster impacts. We conclude that recovery and development planning needs to acknowledge such vulnerabilities to a higher degree. The article contributes to discussions on the societal and governance causes for social vulnerability and is oriented towards actors responsible for planning and disaster management as well as the increasingly impacted public.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",48,2018

An alternative solution, off-grid solar lighting products, such as solar lanterns and solar home systems, increasingly provide Kenyans with decentralized clean energy. Kenya's private sector market for off-grid solar lighting products has been developing since the 1980s, yet the key to rapid market growth was the introduction of a pioneering pay-as-you-go business model in 2011 that made solar products affordable for poor rural customers. Today, with almost 30% of all off-grid households using some type of off-grid solar lighting products, Kenya is a market leader. Other factors that have encouraged market growth include the massive need for power in areas where grid electricity is not available, the high cost and unreliability of grid power where it is available, a value-added tax exemption on solar products, numerous education and awareness campaigns, and expensive kerosene. However, poor quality products present a major challenge. This challenge will have to be overcome for the market to reach its full potential and to ensure that these products represent an effective and lasting lighting solution.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",21,2018

It finds that, when compared with the argument realization of core transitive verbs like BREAK, causative bivalent psych verbs show crosslinguistic uniformity in that they pattern with core transitive verbs in argument realization. The same comparative approach finds that the argument realization of non-causative bivalent psych verbs shows a lot of crosslinguistic variation. As for monovalent psych verbs, the paper finds that they almost always pattern with the argument realization of unaccusative verbs. The findings of the paper are accounted for by using the Force-Control-Causality (FCC) model of verb meaning. Under this model, the uniformity in argument realization with respect to causative bivalent psych verbs is due to the prominence of the causative relationship expressed and the directionality of the causality from the Causer to the Causee. The variation in argument realization with respect to non-causative bivalent psych verbs can be attributed to the fact that such verbs express neither causation nor transmission of physical force. As for the near uniformity in argument realization with respect to monovalent psych verbs, it is due to the fact that they involve only one argument (thus no competition for the subject position) and this single argument shares the [-control] feature with the single argument of unaccusative verbs. This study points to the need of recognizing Causer and Causee as two core and highly-ranked thematic roles in a global thematic hierarchy.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",76,2018

All rights reserved.Research background:Studies of the structures of the income distributions have been performed for about 15 years. They indicate that there is no model which describes the distributions in their whole range. This effect is explained by the existence of different mechanisms yielding to low-medium and high incomes. While more than 97% of the distributions can be described by exponential or log-normal models, high incomes (about 3% or less) are in agreement with the power law. Purpose of the article: The aim of this paper is an analysis of the structure of the household income distributions in Poland. We verify the hypothesis about two-part structure of those distributions by using log-normal and Pareto models. Methods: The studies are based on the households’ budgets microdata for years 2004–2012. The two-component models are used to describe the income distributions. The major parts of the distributions are described by the two parametric log-normal model. The highest incomes are described by the Pareto model. We also investigate the agreement with data of the more complex models, like Dagum, and Singh-Madalla. Findings & Value added: One has showed that two or three parametric models explain from about 95% to more than 99% of income distributions. The poorest agreement with data is for the log-normal model, while the best agreement has been obtained for the Dagum model. However, two-part model: log-normal for low-middle incomes and Pareto model for the highest incomes describes almost the whole range of income distributions very well.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",26,2018

The study shows that a significant contribution to growth rates for the period 2018 through 2024 will be made by the sum of the business cycle and random shock component, which, combined with the revitalization of investments in 2017, may indicate the beginning of a new cycle of economic growth in Russia. In the scenarios reviewed, the contribution from the foreign trade component will be negative from 2018 to 2024. The calculations indicate further stagnation of structural growth rates in the Russian economy from 2018 to 2024 at the level of approximately 1.5 p.p. in all of the basic macroeconomic scenarios reviewed. This points to the inexpediency in postponing structural reforms to create conditions for Russia's economy to achieve growth rates that exceed world averages.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",21,2018

His originality and method are outlined with particular attention being given to his reception in Europe and in the setting of Italian studies of theoretical and empirical linguistics. Whitney was among the first to contest Schleicher's concept of language as a natural fact, claiming, instead, that it has social nature, as an 'institution' created by man; he was a forerunner in recognizing the relevance of signs and their value, and of language acquisition. In his demonstrations and in his methods he proposes a science of historical linguistics but at the same time it is open to 20th century linguistics and the concept of language as a complex system ordered and crossed by relationships. Both his unique approach to the study of Sanskrit, which emphasised the study of its use and its variants, and his interest for modern languages, makes him a particularly interesting scholar, as he and his reception testify the rise, in Europe and especially in Italy, of a new approach to linguistic issues, no longer exclusively historical-comparative, but also theoretical and general. Nonetheless, Whitney ought to occupy a prominent place in the history of linguistics, because he was also the author of one of the first introductory texts of the discipline, which was published in 1875; in that same year a French translation came out, which was soon followed by an Italian, and a German translation (both 1876).The number of almost contemporaneous translations gives an idea of the gap which a general and introductory work like Whitney's filled and illustrates that there was a clear need for it. In several works, including recent ones, De Mauro identified the specific characteristics of Italian linguistic studies: we can find a good many of these traits in Whitney as well. Although the fruitful contribution of Whitney's ideas in an environment which is 'naturally' inclined towards the themes and methods the American linguist dealt with, i.e., the 'Italian linguistic school', has not been fully recognised until now, it is undeniable that his ideas provided an important stimulus for new interpretations and new models.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",81,2018

It is less well known that this medical practitioner also sought to reconcile what he conceived as the mental representation of sounds (the psychological reality of phonemes, i.e. the perception of their differences) with the structural proposals of Troubetzkoy's phonology. His hypotheses, presented before a congress of psychology in 1939, have never been subject to the critical appraisal of linguists. In an eight-page handwritten note first published in this paper, Pichon attempted to make a novel distinction in the vocalic phonology of French by combining the features of aperture and length. He distinguished four cases: (i) an opposition based on both aperture and quantity, (ii) an opposition based only on aperture, (iii) an opposition based on quantity in an open syllable, (iv) an opposition based on quantity in a closed syllable. The examples given relate exclusively to the vowels /o/ and /, without taking into account the other mid vowels. The postulate of an opposition of length that had disappeared since the 17th century is supposed in itself to justify the last two types. This distinction, which is not attested in any register of standard French in the 20th century, is exemplified by four pairs: pot/peau [pot/skin], cheminot/chemineau [railway worker/vagabond], tripot/depôt [bingo parlour/warehouse] and tricot/dispos [knitting/relaxed] in which the first element is considered brief). After having tested these words with some of the people around him, Pichon concludes that this opposition is specific to the upper classes in Paris without realizing that he was transforming the orthographic image of words into an artefact of perception.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",34,2018

They developed the disputable and indeed strongly debated hypothesis that the kind of Latin used by early Christians was a Sondersprache or langue spéciale (later Gruppensprache or langue de groupe) characterized by different types of 'christianisms'. The aim of this article is to contribute to a critical historiography of the Nijmegen School by looking into the reception of its ideas among contemporary Latin linguists. In particular, it tries to reconstruct the evolving appraisals by Alfred Ernout (1879-1973) and Einar Löfstedt (1880-1955), on the basis of (a) the former's reviews of studies published by the Nijmegen School (in contrast to reviews by other contemporary linguists), (b) studies published on neighbouring or overlapping subjects by Einar Löfstedt, and (c) a letter to Mohrmann from each of them, both of which are preserved in the archives of the Katholiek Documentatie Centrum in Nijmegen. In the case of Ernout, it is argued that he was probably always sceptical about the Sondersprache hypothesis, but that in his reviews of the 1930s this scepticism was mitigated to a 'reticent' attitude, possibly for reasons to do with the politics of science. In the case of Löfstedt, it is shown that he initially approved of the hypothesis and even integrated it into his own works, but that he gradually diverged from the Nijmegen School, partly on account of (Schrijnen and) Mohrmann's polemical misrepresentation of his comments on gentes and pagani being semantic Umprägungen rather than Neuprägungen.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",138,2018

Different pore size of porogens were used to control the pore size and porosities of prepared scaffold samples. Some basic properties of scaffold samples were characterized including surface morphology, chemical structure, porosity and mechanical performance. The best porosity of sample reached to 93% in the research.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': 'December 2018', 'day': '31'}",27,2018

Electromagnetic drive is used as the basic method to study the projecting/braking of the shuttle, and it uses the principle of electromagnetic levitation as the basic principle of the shuttle’s weft insertion. In this paper, a basic model of two-way insertion is established. After ANSYS simulation and experimental analysis, the speed of electromagnetic driving can reach 30 m/s. In the electromagnetic levitation stage, PWM modulator and DC power regulation were respectively used to conduct the levitation control experiment. HW101 hall sensor was used to judge the levitation state, and with the assistance of other Operational Amplifier, the requirements of electromagnetic levitation were completed.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': 'December 2018', 'day': '31'}",15,2018

We immersed samples in water at 25 ± 2 ◦C for 30 min, then dried them in a chamber at 40, 60, and 80 ◦C, and at 5% relative humidity (RH). We also investigated the effects of increasing the temperature from 40 to 60 ◦C and decreasing it from 60 to 40 ◦C. After dehydration, we dried the samples using a roller and a front-loader washing and drying machine at various humidity levels. We measured dimensional changes in the samples before and after drying. We investigated five samples of knitted clothing: men’s socks, women’s socks, men’s underwear, women’s underwear, and women’s t-shirts. We detected no difference in the dimensional change ratio in the cotton or polyurethane underwear and t-shirts when the drying temperature was varied. However, the dimensional change ratio of acrylic-containing men’s socks varied depending on the drying temperature. When drying acrylic-containing men’s socks from 40 to 60 ◦C, the dimensional change ratio was larger than under other drying conditions. A lower temperature in the final drying stage could effectively reduce the shrinkage of socks made from acrylic, polyester, and polyurethane. The deformation due to external force during dehydration affected dimensional change. The external force during drying also greatly affected dimensional change in the knitted clothing. The humidity and drying time did not affect dimensional change in the knitted cotton clothing.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': 'December 2018', 'day': '31'}",15,2018

In the case of one official denomination the strict sect attracts less flock, and the monopoly church will acquire more church-goers and even marginally religious people will hesitate between joining the church and staying nonreligious. In case of prohibitively high costs the sect will shrink to zero and the church will take control over almost all population with the remaining small group of nonbelievers. A comparative statics problem in the case of the two official churches was also considered. In stage one of the game these churches choose their position in the strictness interval with the subsequent emergence of sects.

In these structures, the complementizer is preceded by a functional element that morphologically coincides with an adjective or an adverb. From a morphosyntactic viewpoint, we show that these structures are monoclausal and that the epistemic or evidential item preceding the complementizer has undergone a process of grammaticalization becoming a functional element. As for their use and interpretation, we describe their primary semantic meaning, as well as their pragmatic extensions and functions, which involve subjectification and intersubjectivity. We finally propose a syntactic configuration that can account for C-constructions and their properties in the syntax representation. This configuration involves the assumption of a projection – in fact, a set of projections – above ForceP which encode speaker-oriented and pragmatic features (e.g. evaluative, evidential, epistemic values).","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",67,2018

Of this output, 40 Mt CO2e comes from cement production. This makes the cement industry a key sector to target in Indonesia's quest to reduce its emissions by 26% by 2020. Substantial opportunities exist for the industry to reduce emissions, mainly through clinker substitution, alternative fuels, and the modernization of kiln technologies. However, most of these abatement options are capital intensive and considered as noncore business. Due to this, the private sector is unlikely to voluntarily invest in emission reduction unless it saves money, improves revenue, enhances the strategic position of the firm, or unless governments provide incentives or force adoption through regulatory and policy controls. In this study, we review the profile of the Indonesian cement industry and assess the carbon management and climate policy actions available to reduce emissions. The case highlights opportunities for improved carbon management in emission-intensive industries in developing countries.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",33,2018

Quite reasonably, Glaucon objects that they would seem to be making the guardian’s life worse than it could be. This objection is often referred to as “the happy philosopher problem”. But rather than answering Glaucon, Socrates admonishes him that their focus is instead on the role of the class of guardians and the happiness of the whole city. It turns out this admonition is the last in a string of similar admonitions that Socrates gives to his interlocutors. This paper examines Socrates’ admonition to Glaucon, and its relation to Socrates’ other warnings to focus on the happiness of the city. By examining these admonitions, we can defend Socrates’ dismissal of Glaucon’s question and the happy philosopher problem at 519d.

We have to re-shape our atomic structure, we have to create a new nature, and thus achieve cheerfulness. After understanding our Being, we can understand our Ought.

He argues that education must not only cultivate all the faculties of the student’s mind, but also prepare the child to live and act ethically in the world.

Examples of direct effects include alterations in coastal geomorphology, variations in the chemical content of water and changes in biological composition along the littoral zone. The indirect impacts can involve geological changes and increase vulnerability to natural disasters. Reclamation processes also result in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from vehicle and machinery fuel use and through the release of carbon stored in vegetation, soils and sediment in mangroves and seagrass ecosystems. Considering the global extent of land reclamation, the scale of these emissions is likely to be of widespread interest. The case of Jakarta Bay provides useful insights that can contribute to the improved environmental management of kindred land development projects in Indonesia and other parts of Asia. More than 5,100 ha of new land mass is planned from the Jakarta Bay reclamation.

In it general considerations are primarily expressed about the role of nicknames in human societies (including ancient Greek), relations of nicknames to personal names and divine epithets, terminology of nicknames among the Greeks, and the possible reasons for not very broad development of the practice of nicknaming in Greece during this period. A nickname is a fundamental phenomenon of the history of culture, and its real significance has not yet been appreciated. Nicknames in particular served as means of distinguishing individuals within any society. The names of the ancient Greeks had originally resembled nicknames as much as possible. Onomastic units in Greek poleis were mostly meaningful. Nicknames can be assigned—not from a semantic but rather from an emotional point of view— to three basic types. We deal with nicknames of a) a positive, exalted character (“Olympian” as to Pericles); b) a negative, pejorative character (“Coalemos”—“Simpleton” as to Cimon the Elder); c) a neutral character—those that show a certain characteristic appearance of an individual (e.g., “One-Eyed”), or some kind of memorable detail of his biography (Hipponicus the “Ammon” in Athens at the turn of the 6th and 5th centuries BC). Another interesting thing took place in pre-Hellenistic times. Nicknames were more often con-nected not with politicians and state figures but with people from cultural spheres—poets, phi-losophers.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",57,2018

The vote appeared to be a democratic means to facilitate community empowerment in the decision-making process. However, in this study, we show that the vote resulted in an increase in conflict and polarisation, challenged the legitimacy of the consultative process and credibility of the proponents, and ultimately led to legal actions taken by opponents against the proponent. Factors including voter eligibility, the benchmark for success of the vote, campaigning, and responses to the outcome of the vote are examined to demonstrate the complexity of decision-making for renewable energy and land use change more generally.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",27,2018

However, most of this kind of studies concentrate on exporting enterprises and compare them to domestic ones. Exporting activity is very important for catching-up countries, because of technology transfer in its background. Purpose of the article: The aim of this paper is to determine whether the innovative activity in Poland’s manufacturing system is a consequence of close interactions (local and region-al), or perhaps conditioned by the imperative of functioning on the national and international market. The main hypothesis was that on the current development level of Poland, the relationship between the range of sales and innovation activities are different from those in the more developed countries. Methods: Empirical studies was created in 2006–2012 as a result of the systematic collec-tion of questionnaires filled by manufacturing enterprises in Poland from all regions (5209 correct fulfilled questionnaires). Methodical analysis was based on the theory of probability — probit modeling, because dependent variables were binary (0 or 1). Findings & Value added: Local and regional space is not stimulating innovation activity in opposite to national one. High intensity observed only when the company has been working on the international market.

Quarterly Journal of Economics and Economic Policy,"[('Szkola Glówna Handlowa w Warszawie', 'Warsaw', 'Poland')]","© 2018, Institute of Economic Research. All rights reserved.Research background:The position of a country in the international division of labour is determined by the competitiveness of its trade, the structure of which may both reveal and perpetuate the comparative advantages possessed. This is particularly true for Dutch disease economies such as Russia. Recently, economic literature has seen a growing interest in the topic of Russia’s economic relations with the European Union and China. This article is aimed at being the Author’s contribution to this discussion. Purposes of the article: (1) to discuss the existing trade interdependence between Russia and the EU28, and Russia and China; (2) to try to assess the extent to which the current structure of Russian trade with these two partners corresponds with the competitiveness of the Russian economy. Methods: An in-depth analysis of Russia-EU28 and Russia-China trade interdependencies in 2007–2015 has been conducted, with emphasis on the categories of goods within the spectrum from low-to high-technology, according to the OECD classification. Furthermore, in order to analyse Russia’s competitive profile with regard to the same categories of goods, Balassa’s methodology of revealed comparative advantages has been applied. Findings & Value added: In the recent years, a growing importance of China in Russian trade turnover can be observed, being the effect of dynamic growth of Chinese economy, cooling political relations between Moscow and Brussels and the drop in oil prices in international markets. The existing structure of Russian trade with the EU28 and China seems likely to preserve its traditional competitive advantages in the medium-low-technology goods and oil, which, in turn, will only further exacerbate the negative consequences of the so-called Dutch disease affecting the Russian economy.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",53,2018

Quarterly Journal of Economics and Economic Policy,"[('Poznań University of Economics and Business', 'Poznan', 'Poland')]","© 2018, Institute of Economic Research. All rights reserved.Research background:The commercialization of non-governmental organizations through undertaking an activity based on the commercial sale of services and products is a phenomenon which raises controversy among numerous researchers. Traditionally, NGOs act in a sector of social services to solve problems, such as homelessness, exclusion or social pathologies. They also provide different services which cannot be provided by the market, for instance in education, the healthcare system, culture, or art. Driven by a social mission, NGOs introduce their concepts, strongly relying on fees to perform their activity. They also obtain funds in the form of public donations or payments from private or institutional do-nors. Growing social needs and changes in the governmental policy aimed at reducing so-cial-aid spending have put pressure on NGOs to develop entrepreneurial strategies to gain financial support. Purpose of the article: The aim of the paper is to investigate how particular funding sources affect the probability of non-governmental organizations’ commercialization. Methods: Data for the analyses have been collected from a national survey of Polish nongovernmental organizations. In the analysis of logistic regression, a specially-developed model was used to estimate the probability of NGOs’ commercialization, depending on the selected categories of funding sources. Findings & Value added: An analysis of the results indicates clearly that the likelihood of NGOs’ commercialization slightly decreases as a greater number of private external financial sources is used. In contrast with existing literature, which claims that government funding is crowding out commercial activity, this research finds that, to some extent, public funds positively stimulate the commercialization of NGOs. The contribution of this research is that it introduces the category of internal financing sources of non-profit organizations, which have been overlooked in previous studies. The article provides clear statistical arguments demonstrating that private internal revenues strongly affect the commercialization of the organizations surveyed. The paper is the first to present a model that comprehensively considers the probability of NGOs’ commercialization, including private external and inter-nal, as well as public, sources of funding.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",47,2018

Little research has considered how these conventions are retained and/or adapted as gestures are integrated into emerging sign language lexicons. Here we describe a set of five gestures that are used to convey negative meanings by both speakers and signers in a single community: the San Juan Quiahije municipality in Oaxaca, Mexico. We show that all of the form-meaning mappings present for non-signers are retained by signers as they integrate the gestures into their lexicon. Interestingly, additional meanings are mapped to the gesture forms by signers - a phenomenon that appears to originate with deaf signers in particular. In light of this evidence, we argue that accounts of 'wholesale borrowing' of gestures into emerging sign languages is overly simplistic: signers evidently adapt gestures as they integrate them into their emerging lexicons.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",74,2018

In this sense, the designation and legitimation of leadership, as well as the desirable attributes for the successor, emerge as key factors. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the leadership types and desirable attributes chosen for the succession process. To account for the above, a questionnaire was applied to a sample of 144 executives and employees from tourist organizations of service, commerce and industry in the northwestern region of Mexico. Questionnaires were based on a Likert scale type (1 to 5), including sections about leadership (comprised by five dimensions) and the desirable attributes of the successor (comprised by two dimensions). Our results emphasize that the leadership in the first four generations (before, during and after the succession process), present a constant of importance in the presence of the types: Expert, referential and laissez faire/mission and the administrative attributes. Furthemore, participatory leadership decreases and autocratic increases while the family attributes do so as they go from one successor stage to another.

Published by Oxford University Press.Poly(R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (PHB) is a biodegradable natural polymer produced by microorganisms and plants under nitrogen deprivation and physiological stress. Metabolic engineering and synthetic biology approaches are underway to develop strains that can produce PHB and its co-polymers. One of the major limitations to the scaling and success of strain development for biosynthesis of PHB is the absence of fast, accurate, quantitative and scalable methods to estimate PHB in polymer producing cells. In this study, a Nile red-based spectrofluorometric method is developed for absolute quantitation of PHB in recombinant Escherichia coli. The method is a modification of an existing Nile red-based method currently only used for relative quantitation. The two added steps of sonication and ethanol extraction increase the dynamic range of the assay and limit of detection/quantitation. Sonication of PHB standards provides uniform distribution of surface area to volume ratios. This ensures reproducibility and accuracy (lower %relative error) of quantitative staining of granules by Nile red even in a higher dynamic concentration range of 125-1000 μg/ml. Ethanolic extraction of the PHB bound Nile red allows higher recovery and accurate absolute quantitation. To reproduce high recovery and ensure accuracy and precision of the analytical method directly using cells, a protein digestion step was added. This accounted for fluorescence from over-expressed protein and resulted in screening of nonproducers of PHB amongst samples. Thus, the method developed is rapid, accurate, and reproducible, requires low sample volumes and processing compared to other conventional methods. This method is scalable to other PHA's and diverse plastics.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2018

However, such techniques often fail to differentiate between closely related species that have highly variable genomes. Here, a homogenous (closed-tube) pathogen identification and classification method is described that combines PCR amplification, array-based amplicon sequence verification, and real-time detection using an inverse fluorescence fluorescence-resonance energy transfer technique. The amplification is designed to satisfy the inclusivity criteria and create ssDNA amplicons, bearing a nonradiating quencher moiety at the 5-terminus, for all the related species. The array includes fluorescent-labeled probes which preferentially capture the variants of the amplicons and classify them through solid-phase thermal denaturing (melt curve) analysis. Systematic primer and probe design algorithms and empirical validation methods are presented and successfully applied to the challenging example of identification of, and differentiation between, closely related human rhinovirus and human enterovirus strains.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",36,2018

Published by Oxford University Press.The current Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq platforms can generate paired-end reads of up to 2 x 250 bp and 2 x 300 bp in length, respectively. These read lengths may be substantially longer than genomic regions of interest when a DNA sequencing library is prepared through a target enrichment-based approach. A sequencing library preparation method has been developed based on the homology-based enzymatic DNA fragment assembly scheme to allow processing of multiple PCR products within a single read. Target sequences were amplified using locus-specific PCR primers with 8 bp tags, and using the tags, homology-based enzymatic DNA assembly was performed with DNA polymerase, T7 exonuclease and T4 DNA ligase. Short PCR amplicons can hence be assembled into a single molecule, along with sequencing adapters specific to the Illumina platforms. As a proof-of-concept experiment, short PCR amplicons (57-66 bp in length) derived from genomic DNA templates of field pea and containing variable nucleotide locations were assembled and sequenced on the MiSeq platform. The results were validated with other genotyping methods. When 5 PCR amplicons were assembled, 4.3 targeted sequences (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) on average were successfully identified within each read. The utility of this for sequencing of short fragments has consequently been demonstrated.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",17,2018

This article proposes to analyze the case of a wind farm project in the municipality of St-Valentin, Quebec, Canada near the border with Vermont, which was cancelled by the government due to lack of social acceptance, in order to illustrate the importance of this norm today. The project involved the construction of 25 turbines to generate 52 MW of power. Launched in 2006, the project was already significantly under way by 2008; however, in 2011, the government permanently shelved it. Through a combination of document analysis and 11 interviews, we identified the main reasons for the lack of social acceptability: lack of upstream consultation from the developer and wrong scale planned for the consultation process, controversies surrounding the public decision-making process, profound contradictions between the community's values and interests and the nature of the project, and perceptions of the impacts on the landscape and conflicting uses. For better project social acceptability, lessons learned from this case suggest from a procedural perspective opting for broad, open, and early consultation, prioritizing a regional scale for the approach and acting with transparency, clear rules and a concern for building an ongoing relationship with stakeholders. From a more substantive perspective, our analysis points to the importance of factoring in the level of compatibility between the nature of the project and the values and interests shared by stakeholders in the community, and planning potential modifications to adapt the project to the context in light of their demands.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2018

They claimed extensive health damages due to the level of contamination of the basin. The lawsuit was filed against the federal, provincial, and city governments, as well as 44 private companies [1]. This case study introduces readers to the growing pattern of judicialization of environmental policies. This trend was initially celebrated by many activists since a Supreme Court responsive to people's demands and focused on protecting the environment could address long-standing policy failures of the executive and legislative branches of government. However, this case study examines two main ways in which judicialization may generate an accountability crisis for communities affected by environmental disasters. First, it raises a theoretical argument that a Court that takes on managerial functions beyond its adjudicative role distorts the normal horizontal accountability functions that are part of the division of powers between the three branches of government. Second, it empirically demonstrates that a Court's involvement in policy formulation does not guarantee effectiveness and precludes vertical accountability, since citizens cannot vote judges out of office. The case suggests that judicializing environmental politics is fraught with risks to democratic accountability. These must be considered carefully before embracing the judiciary as a band-aid remedy to an executive branch that fails to protect people and the environment.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",39,2018

I will assume that, in satire, these factors include a range of linguistic and rhetorical devices which interact in different ways to dynamically bring about specifically intended effects. I will further claim that understanding satire is a context-sensitive complex process which implies setting up and maintaining multiple mental representations, and drawing pragmatic inferences.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",48,2018

The EC-Model is a usage-based and emergentist model of language knowledge and convention rooted in cognitive linguistics and usage-based approaches. It sees knowledge as emerging from language usage, and explains the processes underlying the intertwining of social practice and cognition. However, so far, no suggestion has been advanced on how to extend the model to account for entrenchment and conventionalization at the supra-sentential level. In the area of genre studies various attempts have been made by scholars to develop or apply theories belonging to different scientific domains to understand the nature of genre. However, so far, there has been no research that applies a unified model in the attempt to link entrenchment of genres in individuals to their conventionalization at the societal level. I largely focus on the long tradition of rhetorical studies of genre, one among the different approaches that, over time, have regarded genre as their main topic of investigation. I concentrate on this tradition as it opens up the entire field of enquiry that defines contemporary genre research. To these I add by showing how the explanations provided so far can be cognitively clarified and unified under the EC-Model. The paper, then, argues that the EC-Model is theoretically apt to address questions about the nature of genre, capturing in an elegant way the interplay between cognition and social interaction in genre emergence, evolution, stabilization and variation.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",104,2018

We argue that argumentation can contribute to instances of different discourse genres, regardless of whether it is functional to their purposes. By analyzing examples from the daily press in the light of an approach to discourse analysis inspired by pragmatics, we show that also texts that are not expected to be argumentative have underlying argumentative structures and that a text's being argumentative is a matter of degree: the understanding of underlying argumentative structures contributes to a varying extent to the understanding of what a text as a whole means and of its point in the speech situation. This role of argumentative structures in text understanding suggests considering argumentation as a cognitively-based dimension of discourse, connected to human rationality.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",36,2018

It elucidates genre as struggle, i.e. how the emerging genre exemplifes various struggles on three strata: the difculties facing patients, doctors, and health providers at practice level; the changes anticipated to take place at discourse level; and the tensions in the pragmatics-cognition-society nexus. Particularly illustrated here are fve struggles that characterize changes or breakthroughs that PDAs are anticipated to make. It suggests that the fve struggles roughly correspond to fve principles for genre theory proposed by Berkenkotter and Huckin (1993), with some modifcation of the latter. It also illustrates that genre intervenes in the complexity between social issues and social cognition and that PDAs as a new genre involve restructuring, reshaping and redesigning the key discourse facets (e.g. prior discourse, participants, language, medium, the world, and purpose). Based on examples of Chinese-language PDAs ofcially released in Taiwan and on information from health professionals, policy makers, and PDA developers, this study contributes empirical evidence toward a better understanding of an emerging genre.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",45,2018

In essence, it will be argued that the monumental creations of this period embody a configuration of Athenian temporality; organizing synoptic episodes into an ethno-cultural continuum. A required element to this process involves the incitement of landscapes, as the framework into which cultural memory is positioned and incited. This also includes the election of totemic figures, which act simultaneously as emblems of distinct eras and coalescence group memory around heroic events. The provision of those elements necessary for cultural remembering within these monuments, indicate them as affording an overtly formative arena for Athenian collective identity. Moreover, as well as organizing Athenian temporality via narratives of primordial origin, the monuments also display the inclusion of historical, biographical, memory into registers of cultural remembering.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",54,2018

All right reserved.Monitoring aquatic biodiversity through DNA extracted from environmental samples (eDNA) combined with high-throughput sequencing, commonly referred to as eDNA metabarcoding, is increasing in popularity within the scientific community. However, sampling strategies, laboratory protocols and analytical pipelines can influence the results of eDNA metabarcoding surveys. While the impact of laboratory protocols and analytical pipelines have been extensively studied, the importance of sampling strategies on eDNA metabarcoding surveys has not received the same attention. To avoid underestimating local biodiversity, adequate sampling strategies (i.e. sampling intensity and spatial sampling replication) need to be implemented. This study evaluated the impact of sampling strategies along an altitudinal and biodiversity gradient in the upper section of the Murrumbidgee River (Murray-Darling Basin, Australia). An eDNA metabarcoding survey was used to determine the local fish biodiversity and evaluate the influence of sampling intensity and spatial sampling replication on the biodiversity estimates. The results show that optimal eDNA sampling strategies varied between sites and indicate that river morphology, species richness and species abundance affect the optimal sampling intensity and spatial sampling replication needed to accurately assess the fish biodiversity. While the generality of the patterns will need to be confirmed through future studies, these findings provide a basis to guide future eDNA metabarcoding surveys in river systems.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",71,2018

While the target of the criticism is often the curriculum, it has often been noted that programmatic bifurcations mirror institutional hierarchies, e.g. status differences between specialists in literary and cultural studies and experts in applied linguistics and language pedagogy (e.g. Maxim et al., 2013; Allen & Maxim, 2012). This chapter looks at the two-tiered structure of collegiate modern language departments from the perspectives of the transdisciplinary shape-shifters who maneuver within them - scholars working between applied linguistics and literary studies. These individuals must negotiate the methodologies and the institutional positions available to them - in many instances, the latter is what has prompted them to work between fields in the first place. The particular context of US foreign language and literature departments serves as a case study of the lived experiences of doing transdisciplinary work in contexts that are characterized by disciplinary hierarchies and the chapter ends with a call for applied linguistics to consider not only the epistemic, but also the institutional and affective labor needed to sustain transdisciplinary work.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",35,2018

This paper shows how research on financial communication with and for practitioners (Cameron, Frazer, Rampton, & Richardson, 1992, p. 22) can foster intra-lingual translation in the financial sector, which increases financial texts' communicative potential and finally enables laypersons to better understand the language of numbers. Transdisciplinary Action Research (TDA) offers a framework and procedures to approach such goals through close collaboration of scholars and practitioners throughout research projects. Following TDA core concepts, a cyclic process of research and development has been established in the last two decades (e.g. Perrin, this volume; Whitehouse, 2014). Whereas applied linguists involved aimed at better understanding practices of writing and intra-lingual translation at the interface of technical and everyday language, stakeholders from the financial industry wanted to improve their communication. The representatives of society-at-large, finally, were interested in contributing to sustainably increasing financial literacy. In the first part of the present paper, I sketch the suitability of transdisciplinarity in general and TDA in particular in financial communication (Section 1). Then I define the key concepts of intra-lingual translation, communicative potential, and financial literacy (Section 2). Next, I outline the data corpus and explain how TDA was applied in a series of research projects (Section 3).

Research with the picture-word interference paradigm has shown that speakers can plan all elements of such utterances up to the phonological level before initiating speech, yet magnitude and direction of this phonological priming effect (i.e. facilitative vs. inhibitory) differ between but also within studies. We investigated possible sources for variability in the phonological advance planning scope. In two experiments, participants produced bare nouns (“monkey”) and complex noun phrases (“the small red monkey”) while ignoring distractor words phonologically (un)related to the noun. For low- and high-working memory capacity speakers as well as fast and slow speakers, we found phonological facilitation effects for the bare noun, but no distractor effects for the complex noun phrases. However, looking at individual distractor effects for utterance-final elements revealed a large variability between speakers. We conclude that phonological advance planning cannot be summarised as an overall effect, but should take into account inter- and intraindividual variability.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",38,2018

We specifically examined compounds with plural or singular modifiers in English. Thirty-one advanced L2 speakers of English (L1: German) were compared to a control group of 20 L1 English speakers from an earlier study. We found an enhanced (right-frontal) negativity during (silent) morphological encoding for compounds produced from regular plural forms relative to compounds formed from irregular plurals, replicating the ERP effect obtained for the L1 group. The L2 speakers’ overt productions, however, were significantly less consistent than those of the L1 speakers on the same task. We suggest that L2 speakers employ the same mechanisms for morphological encoding as L1 speakers, but with less reliance on grammatical constraints than L1 speakers.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",56,2018

HKSL does not show impersonal uses of personal pronouns (e.g., they, you) which are commonly found in spoken languages. The nominal strategies are determined by the contexts and the referential properties of the impersonal referents, and they differ in the use of space in representing the impersonal referents in subsequent discourse. R-impersonal referents encoded by onedet-path (someone)/onedet-path (anyone) are associated with an area of the upper part of the ipsilateral side of the signing space, but they can still be assigned to a specific locus if the subsequent discourse requires locative information.

Recently, a growing number of studies are focusing on the distribution of two representation techniques, i.e. the use of entity handshapes and handling handshapes for the depiction of hand-held tools (e.g. Ortega et al. 2014). Padden et al. (2013) find that there is cross-linguistic variation in the use of this pair of representation techniques. This study looks at variation in a representation technique that has not been systematically studied before, i.e. the delimitation of a stretch of space to depict the size of a referent, or space-based distance for size depiction. It considers the question whether the cross-linguistic variation in the use of this representation technique is governed by language-specific patterning as well (cf. Padden et al. 2013). This study quantifies and compares the occurrence of space-based distance for size depiction in the lexicons of six sign languages, three of Western European origin, and three of West African origin. It finds that sign languages differ significantly from each other in their frequency of use of this depiction type. This result thus corroborates that the selection and distribution of representation techniques does not solely depend on features of the depicted image, but also on language-specific patterning in the distribution of representation techniques, and it adds another dimension of iconic depiction in which sign languages may vary from each other (in addition to the entity/handling handshape distinction). Moreover, the results appear to be areally defined, with the three European languages using this representation technique significantly more often than the three African languages.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",29,2018

Assuming that use of metaphor could make political language easier to comprehend, more and more scholars began to focus on the study of metaphor in political discourse. However, most of these studies paid only attention to the contrastive study of single metaphor phenomena, while diachronic studies of metaphors still remained few. Te present paper attempts to make a diachronic analysis of metaphor clusters in American and Chinese political discourse. Te data employed are American and Chinese leaders' political speeches, addressed to university students; the Chinese corpus contains 119021 characters, while the American corpus includes 118805 words. Te research was implemented over three periods, namely before 1900, from 1900 to 2010, and from 2010 up to now (when the new term “metaphor cluster” was introduced to study the clustering phenomena of metaphor in diferent periods). In addition, both qualitative analysis and qualitative analysis were employed; the linguistic analysis tool Wmatrix and MIPVU procedures were adopted to identify metaphor clusters, thereby remedying the shortcomings of traditional methods which identify metaphor through researchers' intuition and perception. Qualitative analysis was used to conduct a contrastive analysis of dominant metaphor clusters and how they tend to be used by the lecturers, both in the American and the Chinese corpuses. Te data analysis shows that metaphor clusters abound in American and Chinese leaders' political speeches in universities. Generally speaking, Chinese leaders adopt more metaphor clusters than do their American counterparts. Similar metaphor clusters in both data are: journey, family, and building. Circle and art metaphor clusters are unique to the Chinese data, while religion and drama metaphor clusters only occur in the American data. Before 1990, leaders adopted few metaphor clusters both in America and in China; the two decades from 1990 to 2010 witnessed a peak season of employing metaphor clusters in both Chinese and American leaders' speeches, whereas afer 2010, the usage of metaphor clusters in Chinese data ushered in a new stage of development, with a multitude of new metaphorical expressions having cultural connotations. Te results reveal that the differences in the usage of metaphor clusters are mainly due to the various ideologies and cultural backgrounds of the two countries. In addition, our analysis also shows that the employment of metaphor clusters in political discourse could lead the audiences' direction of thinking, reduce the audiences' comprehensive burden, and arouse the audiences' emotions.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",28,2018

Predicational clefts look special because of the narrow focus on the adjective within an indefinite pivot, but their special properties can all be derived from this narrow focus in a focus analysis in which it-clefts express contrasting focus. Contrasting focus means that besides the assertion of the proposition expressed in the cleft, there is one contrasting proposition which is excluded. The focus on the adjective in apparent predicational clefts gives rise to a narrow set of relevant alternatives, all of which differ only in the adjectival property within the pivot. The analysis developed here can account for many of the observations for apparent predicational clefts. Other properties are shown to be not conclusive.

Like many other languages, Dutch has several presentational constructions, including a Prosodic Inversion Construction (PIC), a Syntactic Inversion with Filler Insertion Construction (SIFIC) and a Non-Prototypical Cleft Construction (NPC). This article investigates these structures as alternating presentational constructions and focuses on referential givenness as a possible factor influencing the alternation. Based on a data elicitation task, referential givenness is shown to play a role in the choice of alternant. The PIC is predominantly used with unused/inactive and accessible Mental Representations of Referents (MRRs), but it can also contain brand-new MRRs. The NPC is exclusively used with brand-new MRRs. The SIFIC is used mostly with brand-new MRRs, but it can also contain accessible MRRs, in particular in positions other than the syntactic subject. The data elicitation task yielded a number of additional Dutch linguistic structures that could also be considered presentational constructions, including a construction with a perception verb used in a weak verb-like fashion and a construction with an existential sentence combined with a coordinated canonical topic-comment clause.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",96,2018

In this paper, I examine the case of presentational ci-sentences in Italian, which have developed exactly this new function out of existential sentences. Despite being superficially similar to existential sentences, as well as to clefts, presentational ci-sentences must be kept separate from both sentence types, and must be treated as an independent construction with distinct structural and functional properties. Unlike existentials, presentational ci-sentences assert the existence of an event or situation and involve a predicational structure characterized by a CP (the relative clause) that functions as the predicate of the DP. Unlike clefts, which are typically used to mark narrow focus, presentational ci-sentences display a sentence-focus structure whereby the event is presented as all new. A contrastive analysis of presentational ci-sentences against existentials and clefts will thus allow us not only to understand the exact boundaries between these constructions, but also to identify more precisely the distinctive characteristic properties of each sentence type.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",69,2018

Thus, a compound word such as goldfish is composed of the constituent words gold and fish. In this report, we present evidence that compound words such as goldfish might not contain the words gold and fish, but rather positionally bound compound constituents (e.g., gold- and -fish) that are distinct and often in competition with their whole word counterparts. This conceptualization has significant methodological consequences: it calls into question the assumption that, in a traditional visual constituent priming paradigm, the participant can be said to be presented with constituents as primes. We claim that they are not presented with constituents. Rather, they are presented with competing freestanding words. We present evidence for the processing of Hebrew compound words that supports this perspective by revealing that, counter-intuitively, prime constituent frequency has an attenuating effect on constituent priming. We relate our findings to previous findings in the study of German compound processing to show that the effect that we report is fundamentally morphological rather than positional or visual in nature. In contrast to German in which compounds are always head-final morphologically, Hebrew compounds are always head initial. In addition, whereas German compounds are written as single words, Hebrew compounds are always written with spaces between constituents. Thus, the commonality of patterning across German and Hebrew is independent of visual form and constituent ordering, revealing, as we claim, core features of the constituent priming paradigm and compound processing.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",22,2018

To this end, the paper draws on Jonathan Culpeper’s cognitive stylistic theory of top-down and bottom-up processes in literary text comprehension and characterization. Based on this holistic framework, the paper takes advantage of such stylistic tools as speech acts, the Cooperative Principle and politeness theory to examine features of the language used by the characters Proctor and Danforth. In this regard, the article assimilates those linguistic elements with the embedded schemata within the play. Consequently, the study reveals that Proctor’s complex characterization does not coincide with the readers’ schema and thus they form their impression of his character based on piecemeal integration. On the other hand, Danforth’s character reinforces the readers’ schema about a representative of the church discourse and thus they comprehend his character on the basis of confirmatory categorization. The paper concludes that while Proctor and Danforth have a passive existence in the text or in people’s minds, it is only in the interaction between their language and the readers’ minds that they come into existence.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",45,2018

It is hypothesized that studying the relationships between these lexemes, their etymologies, and frequency can provide a detailed, integrative account of metaphorical aspects and conceptual systems related to each spatial orientation. A bottom-up methodology to identify metaphorical usages of spatial lexemes was applied to the Stanford Arabic Corpus. The results list the spatial linguistic metaphors comprising conceptual metaphors and show for each orientation that mapping orientations onto conceptual metaphors is a complicated process, which integrates linguistic and cognitive levels.

We propose a three-way distinction between division of labor, agreement, and general collocation to categorize the different ways in which elements inside discourse segments interact with connectives in the marking of coherence relations.

All rights reserved.Research background:The first business support organizations (BSO) appeared in Poland in the 90s of the last century. They were transferred from Western Europe and the United States, where they provided system solutions and played an important role in stimulating innovation activity. However, the latter regions are economically developed, while Poland is playing catch-up. The important question is whether business support organizations will significantly increase the innovative potential of Polish enterprises. Purpose of the article: The purpose of this paper is to probe the impact of business support organizations on innovation activity in Polish industrial companies. It remains to be determined whether enterprises which use BSO services are more likely to engage in innovation activities than enterprises which do not use such services. Methods: To carry out the study, a multi-factor logit regression method was used. In this study, the method allows the determination of the odds ratio for the likely occurrence of innovation activity in companies that used the services of BSOs compared to enterprises that did not do so. The attributes of innovation activity have been singled out in accordance with the international standards of the Oslo methodology. The study was conducted in 2015 for the years 2012–2014 based on a sample of 951 manufacturing companies in the Masovian Voivodeship. Findings & Value added: In the Masovian Voivodeship it is the technological parks and training and consulting centres which have the most advanced degree of influence on the innovation activity of enterprises. The roles of technology incubators, and loan and guarantee funds are also significant.

However, if we consider language teaching and learning as practice, this fit is not as neat as it at first might appear. Teaching, learning and using an additional language is complex and multifaceted; it involves languages, cultures, learning, communication, identities, etc., which in turn are situated academically within a host of disciplines. Research in language teaching and learning is therefore transdisciplinary in the sense that multiple disciplines can provide different lenses through which to understand the same phenomena and to build new understandings of the object of interest. Moreover, as a field in which languages and cultures are inherently brought into contact, language teaching and learning is also at an intersection between disciplines that are conceptualized and developed differently in different languages and academic traditions. For example, 'language teaching' as a disciplinary area does not map well onto its French translation equivalent 'didactique des langues'. These interactions across academic traditions therefore represent an oftenunacknowledged form of transdisciplinarity. This contribution will examine how language teaching and learning can be informed by a transdisciplinary perspective in both these senses. In particular, it will focus on the idea of language learning from an intercultural perspective to examine how multiple disciplines and different disciplinary traditions contribute to shaping understanding of the field; it will also consider some of the challenges of bringing multiple disciplines to bear on this understanding.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",51,2018

First, while interdisciplinarity may allow for disciplines to stay in place and engage with each other, transdisciplinarity implies a space beyond or above disciplines. As a result, we have to consider whether applied linguistics is seen as a discipline (in which case it is not transdisciplinary) or whether it is seen as a transdisciplinary field of study (in which case it is not a discipline). Second, while applied linguists may engage with work from other fields - sociology, geography, philosophy, cognitive science are common examples - this does not necessarily mean that we engage with those fields as disciplines. Rather, the engagement with such work is often on the basis that relevant thinkers are engaging themselves with broader epistemic shifts. Such work may therefore be seen as having to do with epistemes rather than disciplines. Third, a focus on transdisciplinarity obscures broader concerns about unequal relations of knowledge production, particularly between North and South. If applied linguistics is to become a responsible field of work, it needs to engage with southern epistemologies. In order to do so, applied linguistic practices can be more usefully understood as temporary assemblages of thought and action that come together at particular moments when language-related concerns need to be addressed. This flexible account helps us see how applied linguistic practices are assemblages of different language-oriented projects, epistemes and matters of concern.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",77,2018

The app presents organizational and planning tools to improve the daily life of these individuals, and, consequently, their well-being. A user-centered design approach was employed in the development of the app, and design requirements were established based on the literature on Mental Health, Psychology, Information and Graphic Design. A functional prototype of the app was created for user testing, and a satisfaction questionnaire was conducted with potential users. The results showed that Compass was a useful and usable app, and that its interface design was easy to interact with and navigate. The results also showed that there were some problems with the design of the app. These problems were taken into consideration in the redesign stage and led to improvements.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",19,2018

Such productivity occurs despite the pressure salmon habitats have experienced through a long history of anthropogenic alterations, and continue to face from the region's robust industrial economy, including recreational and commercial fisheries, agricultural production, and forestry. Restoration efforts since the 1980s have helped mitigate environmental impacts, but the turn of the century brought a new era of coordinated research, monitoring, and restoration. Forming a multi-stakeholder partnership with the goal of restoring salmon runs, the local nonprofit Coos Watershed Association and its partners worked together to learn about the strategies that coho use to survive in these altered landscapes and apply research findings to restore habitats. Specifically, they examined the most appropriate habitat restoration strategies for various life histories of coho salmon, while working within social and political constraints. As a result, these efforts over the past 35 years have led to a better understanding of salmon populations in Palouse and Larson Creeks and an effective restoration program that continues till today.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",18,2018

Published by Oxford University Press.Aptamers are oligonucleotide ligands with specific binding affinity to target molecules. Generally, RNA aptamers are selected from an RNA pool with random sequences, using the technique termed SELEX, in which the target-binding RNA molecules are repeatedly isolated and exponentially amplified. Despite several advantages, SELEX often produces uncertain results during the iterative amplifications of the rare target-binding RNA molecules. Here, we develop a non-repeated, primer-less and target immobilization-free isolation method for generating RNA aptamers, which is robust to experimental noise. Uniquely, this method focuses on finding and removal of non-aptamer sequences from the RNA pool by RNase digestion leaving target-bound aptamer molecules, and thus is independent of aptamer types. The undigested RNA sequences remaining are so few in number that they must be mixed with a large excess of a known sequence for further manipulations and this sequence is then removed by restriction digestion followed by high-throughput sequencing analysis to identify aptamers. Using this method, we generated multiple RNA aptamers targeting α-thrombin and TGFβ1 proteins, independently. This method potentially generates thousands of sequences as aptamer candidates, which may enable us to predict a common average sequence or structural property of these aptamers that is different from input RNA.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",56,2018

Words of low polysemy could be preferred as they reduce the disambiguation effort for the listener. However, such preference could be a side-effect of another bias: the preference of children for nouns in combination with the lower polysemy of nouns with respect to other part-of-speech categories. Our results show that mean polysemy in children increases over time in two phases, i.e. a fast growth till the 31st month followed by a slower tendency towards adult speech. In contrast, this evolution is not found in adults interacting with children. This suggests that children have a preference for non-polysemous words in their early stages of vocabulary acquisition. Interestingly, the evolutionary pattern described above weakens when controlling for syntactic category (noun, verb, adjective or adverb) but it does not disappear completely, suggesting that it could result from a combination of a standalone bias for low polysemy and a preference for nouns.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",65,2018

All rights reserved.The present paper addresses Aeschylus, and the way he wanted to be remembered by his fellow Athenians and the other Greeks. Living from 525/524 until 456/455 BCE1, Aeschylus experiences the quick transition of his polis from a small city-state to a leading political and military force to be reckoned with throughout the Greek world. The inscription on his gravestone at Gela, Italy, commemorates his military achievements against the Persians, but makes no mention of his enormous theatrical renown. His plays were so respected by the Athenians that after his death, his were the only tragedies allowed to be restaged in subsequent competitions. And yet Aeschylus, when time came to describe himself and the work of his lifetime, mentioned exclusively his contribution to the fight against the Persian Empire as an Athenian. Triggered by the poet’s narrative on the most memorable moment of his life, the present paper seeks to shed some light on the Athenian political identity, emerged during and soon after the Persian Wars, which not only derived from the newly-established democratic constitution of the late sixth century, but also supported it. Aeschylus’ epigram as well as some particular plays of his (the Persae, the Eumenides, and the Suppliants), narrates the confidence, the solidarity and the feeling of equality the Athenian citizens shared with regard to the defence of freedom of their polis as well as of all Greece, which came before anything else in their life, that is above noble descent and wealth. The gravestone of the poet stresses, in other words, how it felt for an Athenian to live during the emergence of the very first Democracy that supported the claim of Athens to become the ruler in the Aegean by establishing its naval “Empire” ideologically upon the commemoration of the victory of the Athenian Democracy against the “tyranny” of Persia at Marathon and Salamis.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",75,2018

Exposure to zoonotic organisms not only poses health risks to personnel and research animals but may also affect research integrity. Early laboratory animal programs were ineffective at excluding and preventing transmission of zoonotic diseases: the health status of the animals were often unknown, endemic diseases occurred frequently, housing conditions were less controlled, and veterinary care programs were decentralized. Over time, these conditions improved, but despite this, zoonotic diseases remain a contemporary concern. To reduce the incidence of zoonoses, management should perform an accurate risk assessment that takes into account the type of research performed, animal species used, animal sources, and housing conditions. Specific research practices, such as the use of biological materials, can also affect the risk assessment and should be considered. Once identified, the characteristics of significant zoonotic organisms can be examined. In addition, personnel attitudes and training, facility design and management, equipment availability, personal protective equipment used, standard operating procedures, and the institution's vermin control program can impact the risk assessment. The effectiveness of the occupational health and safety program at managing risks of zoonoses should also be examined. Risk assessment, in the context of zoonotic disease prevention, is a complex exercise and is most effective when a team approach is used and includes research, husbandry, veterinary, and biosafety personnel.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",null,2018

The use of animal models requires thoughtful consideration for their well-being, as infections can significantly impact the general health of an animal and impair their welfare. Application of the 3Rs-replacement, refinement, and reduction-to animal models using biohazardous agents can improve the scientific merit and animal welfare. Replacement of animal models can use in vitro techniques such as cell culture systems, mathematical models, and engineered tissues or invertebrate animal hosts such as amoeba, worms, fruit flies, and cockroaches. Refinements can use a variety of techniques to more closely monitor the course of disease. These include the use of biomarkers, body temperature, behavioral observations, and clinical scoring systems. Reduction is possible using advanced technologies such as in vivo telemetry and imaging, allowing longitudinal assessment of animals during the course of disease. While there is no single method to universally replace, refine, or reduce animal models, the alternatives and techniques discussed are broadly applicable and they should be considered when infectious disease animal models are developed.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",null,2018

MPs' reactive statements during the inaugural speech debates in the Austrian parliament,Pragmatics and Society,"[('Universität Wien', 'Vienna', 'Austria')]","© John Benjamins Publishing CompanyThis paper investigates the reference statements and rhetorical functions of politicians' reactive (“uptaking”) statements in parliamentary debates as well as their self-positioning effects. Uptaking moves may be used by speakers for pursuing strategic, global discourse aims. The specific properties of such 'uptaking' utterances and their sequential embedding in the unfolding discourse provide analysts with cues of speakers' global interactional goals. Results indeed show how global and local pragmatic factors impact content, form, and rhetorical function of MPs' uptaking statements. The data comprises four Austrian parliamentary sessions, which follow the inaugural speech each newly appointed Austrian chancellor has to deliver in the Austrian national assembly at the beginning of a legislative term. Overall, four fifths of the uptaking discourse units (consisting of 'reference to previous statement plus comment') refer to the government program, the inaugural speech or a previous MPs' statement. Whereas a closer investigation of the reference statements seems to indicate a left wing vs. right wing rhetorical pattern (with left wing and center parties referring to 'official' sources, while right wing parties set their own topical agenda), investigating the rhetorical functions of the uptaking discourse units reveals a clear government vs. opposition (but no party-specific) rhetoric: Government party MPs praise the government program (or the inaugural speech), opposition party speakers criticize it. Both groups thus focus on the interpersonal plain of interaction. In contrast, argumentative (or counter-argumentative) uptaking discourse units which would indicate speakers' willingness to enter into a rational discourse (in a Habermasian sense) with their political opponents are extremely rare. Through their rhetorical activities, the vast majority of government and opposition speakers thus reinforce and perpetuate already known political stances and affiliations in front of a third party (i.e. the general public watching the debates via TV or Internet livestream) rather than presenting themselves as rational, problem-focused politicians.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",44,2018

Key to PLF is the dense monitoring of variegated parameters, including animal growth, output of produce (e.g. milk, eggs), diseases, animal behaviour, and the physical environment (e.g. thermal micro-environment, ammonia emissions). While its proponents consider PLF a win-win strategy that combines production efficiency with sustainability goals and animal welfare, critics emphasise, inter alia, the potential interruption of human-animal relationships. This paper discusses the notion that the objectification of animals by PLF influences the developmental pathways of conventional industrial farming. We conduct a conceptual analysis of objectification by comparing discussions in feminist ethics and animal ethics. We find that in animal ethics, objectification includes deontological arguments regarding instrumentalisation, de-animalisation, alienation, commodification and quantification of animals. The focus on socio-political context and relationality connects these debates to central ideas in care ethics. We adopt a care ethics perspective to assess the implications of the objectification of animals in livestock farming. The basic claim is that sensory knowledge symbolised by the farmers’ unity of hand, head and heart would make it harder to objectify animals than abstract and instrumental reasoning where the pursuit of knowledge is intertwined with the pursuit of control, as in mainstream PLF. Despite of what can be considered as a good caring relationship between farmers and animals that is mediated by PLF, people involved in conventional industrial farming still seem to become further detached from farmers and animals, because the PLF system itself is objectifying. PLF redefines the notion of care, in terms of data transparency, standardisation of methods for analysis, real-time collection and processing of data, remote control, and the use of digital platforms. This creates new expectations and requires a redistribution of responsibilities within a wider scope of relations in the value chain.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",61,2018

Part of protecting environmental and public health is identifying potential risks before licenses are issued and drilling operations proceed. To this end, two case studies, focusing on the environmental impact assessment (EIA) procedures of California and New York, are analyzed in this paper. Both states have histories of strong environmental protection law and policy [8-10] and legally require an EIA to be conducted before development of HVHF sites [11, 12], an outgrowth of the 1969 federal National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). New York State conducted what appears to be a thorough EIA [13] and concluded that as there were too many gaps in the data on HVHF, fracking could not proceed. California's EIA, which was less extensive, and did not consider health impacts [14], concluded that HVHF could proceed, relatively unabated. A comparison of these cases illustrates that the processes designed to ensure adequate identification, monitoring, and assessment of environmental impacts are prone to differences [15]-an outcome of the fact that laws governing HVHF in the US are not consistent across, nor controlled at, the federal level [16, 17].","{'month': '12', 'year': '2018', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2018'}, 'day': '31'}",96,2018

Primary end-points of the study were overall survival (OS) and mean hospital stay (MHS). Secondary end-points were the description of risk factors of liver abscesses, isolated microorganisms and the specific treatment. Results: In our study the incidence of liver abscesses in cancer patients was 1.18%. Median age was 63 years, 60% were men, and the vast majority of patients had an advanced bilio-pancreatic tumor (85%). With a median follow-up of 18 months, median OS was 6 months (95% CI: 1-11); and OS probability at 18-month was 19%. MHS was 27.2 days (95% CI: 20.3-40.7).

The question arises from the fact that, i n spite of increased diagnoses of completely excised malignant melanoma (MM) in the last two decades, mortality from advanced metastatic disease has not decreased. After a brief review of the literature, the author proposes that the existence of CIHIMELL could be affirmed through post mortem dermoscopy and histological study of any pigmented lesion, clinically or dermoscopically suspected, of several deceased patients undergoing necropsy for death causes unrelated to MM. Should the cumulative prevalence of merely histological melanomas turn out to be exceedingly high and not commensurable with the current death rates of true MM, the discrepancy would tangibly prove that indolent pigmented lesions with morphological aspect of melanoma do exist. This would clearly introduce difficulties that coul d satisfactorily be dealt with only through a paradigm shift in melanoma surveillance and diagnosis (which could also allow to add a piece of “encouraging uncertainty” to the patient-physician relationship). However, it can be expected that such an enterprise would be countered by several vested academic and commercial interests.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2019

All rights reserved.This work consists in studying the numerical simulation of two-dimensional laminar and permanent natural convection in a differentially heated square cavity filled with air. The vertical walls subjected to constant temperatures, while the horizontal walls are considered adiabatic. The mathematical model used to describe our problem was developed based on the Boussinesq approximations. The Navier Stokes and energy equations were solved using the commercialized calculation code (Fluent) by the finite volume method. The study carried out is characterized by graphical visualization of current function contours, isotherms, velocity profiles along x and y and temperature profiles as a function of Rayleigh number variation for pure natural convection. The variation of the Rayleigh number is performed in the range of 102 to 106 for different values of the aspect ratio and for a number of Prandtl Fr = 0.72. The results obtained indicate that the Nusselt number increase is proportional to the increase in Rayleigh number; moreover, the natural convection is obviously very sensitive to the variation of the aspect ratio. Indeed, the results show that the configuration of the vertical cavity gives a better heat transfer. The average Nusselt number is a decreasing function of the cavity aspect ratio.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",11,2019

All rights reserved.Arbitration is an autonomous mechanism for solving disputes, which flows above the domestic procedural rules for litigation. In today’s world, the amendments to the domestic arbitration legislation have been directed at minimising the court’s intervention in order to uphold arbitral autonomy. Yet this process has been greatly complicated in recent years by the increasing use of Third Party Funding (TPF). Modern international arbitration is interspersed with TPF – a legal investment arrangement under which the funder is obliged to pay the cost of arbitration in exchange for a part of the final recovery. TPF has not only increased the court’s willingness to impose and supervise arbitrations but it has also created a larger desire for the party to bring TPF-related issues arising from the arbitration procedure to court. It has been observed that arbitral proceedings that are fuelled by TPF attract more judicial supervision than those that are not. This paper will first explain the challenges posed by TPF to arbitration and then address the uncertainty of what the future might hold for arbitral autonomy as TPF becomes more widespread. This question is asked and answered in China, where recently TPF and its impact have provoked fierce debate. This paper presents and analyses the possible solutions of the issues associated with TPF before concluding that it is possible for China to promote the use of TPF in arbitration without causing harm to arbitral autonomy.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",55,2019

In addition to the cultural contents that an audio-guide can provide, this application is enriched with a spoken dialogue system, a system interacting with humans by means of spoken language commands and requests. The application was developed using Android Studio. Furthermore, the developed interface for the Museum was endowed with dialogic skills modelled in DialogFlow using its Android Software Development Kit (SDK), to which Text-to-Speech technologies were integrated to record the user query. The results are promising in that they display positive feedback for the introduction of such technologies in museums.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",13,2019

The article draws mainly on the empirical experience of both authors, who have performed research mainly in the Korça area, an area of complex linguistic contacts (Albanian-Slavic Macedonian-Greek). The two researchers recorded a number of oral histories in two distinct speeches; one belonging to the Tosk dialect of the Albanian language and the other belonging to the Aromanian dialect of the Romanian language. These two speeches are in danger of becoming extinct for two main reasons: the first being due to the linguistic homogenization of the Albanian dialects into the standard variant (Shkurtaj, 1999), the other being due to the cultural and linguistic assimilation of the Aromanians living in Albania (Capidan, 1943).","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",26,2019

To address these limitations and allow prosodic research to be conducted on almost any kind of ancient or recent recordings showing less than optimal acoustic conditions, several dedicated functions have been integrated in the software program WinPitch. A first set of these functions allow the user to apply alternate pitch tracking algorithms among 7 available on selected signal segments, as some algorithms may perform better than others. If this process appears still unsatisfactory, a set of easy to use graphical commands are available to directly annotate pitch curves graphically, relying on an underlying narrow-band spectrographic display, whose frequency scale is automatically matched with the fundamental frequency curve scale. Piecewise linear graphic lines can be adjusted to melodic movements of any complexity as displayed on the spectrogram. Furthermore, the phonetic or phonological categories of these user placed annotations can be automatically labelled according to predefined classes, such as those available in ToBI notation system, or as melodic contours indicating dependency relations between stress groups.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",8,2019

All rights reserved.This paper addresses the articulatory realization of repeated identical vowels in Italian, such as they exist in root-internal position (e.g. coorte ‘cohort’, Sahara ‘id.’) or across a morpheme boundary (atee ‘atheists.f’, coordinare ‘to coordinate’). In structural terms, these vowel sequences give rise to a hiatus, but their actual realization is variable. At fast speech rate, they may collapse into a single vowel also in terms of total duration. In careful speech, however, they retain a much longer duration than their single vowel counterparts (cf. corte ‘court’, Sara ‘id.’). In addition, and crucially for our purpose, they may exhibit some hints at rearticulation at the boundary between the first and the second vowel. Some evidence that this may indeed occur was found by means of the UTI technique in a corpus of carefully produced speech.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2019

A phonological interpretation is presented, followed by the phonetic analysis of the rhotic consonant in marked clusters recurring in the dialect of Suelli (Campidanese Sardinian group). In spite of their intrinsic articulatory complexity, such clusters do not show acoustic differences as compared to cross-linguistically unmarked consonant clusters. Our analysis is focused on the rhotic consonant: its phonetic behaviour in such clusters is compared to that of /r/ in unmarked clusters and intervocalic environment. In particular, we looked for patterns analogous to those found in literature concerning marked clusters of the Campidanese typology. The analysis is based on fieldwork data and has showed that no particular acoustic pattern is at work when aberrant clusters are concerned. It will be claimed that the cross-linguistically systematic presence of a vowel portion preceding taps in Cr clusters and the high number of rhotic variants do not have phonological relevance in determining the syllabic status of Campidanese aberrant clusters.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",37,2019

All rights reserved.There are many arguments in doctrine and case-law concerning the issue of the admissibility of a revocation of a donation made to the joint marital property if only one of them shows gross ingratitude towards the donor. Many of the opinions discussed in the article go beyond the topic of the admissibility of the revocation of a donation in favour of the return of an object after the revocation of the donation. The admissibility of the revocation of the donation should be considered regardless of the problem of returning the item, which occurs only after the effective revocation of the donation. The issue of the admissibility or inadmissibility of a revocation of a donation cannot be determined by the existence of potential obstacles in the future return of the object after the revocation of the donation. The position allowing for partial revocation of a donation should be supported, as the arguments in favour of this view take into account the principles of social coexistence and appear to be the most equitable solution from the point of view of the interests of both the donor and the beneficiaries. If one of the spouses shows grossly reprehensible behaviour, the donor should retain its right to revoke the donation in any case, as this right results from the provisions of the Civil Code. However, it is essential that the possibility to revoke a donation should apply only to the person who has presented gross ingratitude, in the absence of a legal basis for extending liability to the other spouse. Consequently, the stance on the partial admissibility of revocation of a donation should be regarded as the most appropriate.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2019

All rights reserved.The article at hand delves into the topic of ‘expanded judicial review’ in international commercial arbitration. The phrase ‘expanded judicial review’ refers to the situation when the parties in their arbitration agreement stipulate that, in addition to the available statutory grounds (which are generally extremely narrow), the court should set aside an arbitral award for the arbitral tribunal’s misapplication of law and/or errors of fact. Several years ago, the question of whether the contractual stipulations calling for an expanded judicial review ought to be honoured was fervently debated both by the courts (especially in the United States) and the scholarly community. Eventually, at least in the international context, the approach perceiving the statutory grounds for setting aside an arbitral award as being exhaustive seems to have won the battle. After exploring the topic of ‘expanded judicial review’ from the private parties’ perspective (and by employing the law and economics analysis), this article reaches the conclusion that is in discord with the current situation on the ground; i.e., it is the jurisdictions that would have the narrow grounds for setting aside as the default solution, but would allow the parties to expand them freely that would offer the optimal approach from theprivate parties’ perspective. At least among the jurisdictions that are considered to be major arbitration hubs, these are nowhere to be found. While acknowledging the reasons in favour of disallowing expanded judicial reviews, this article suggests that the strong dominance of such an approach should be reduced by at least having one or two major arbitration jurisdictions to enable the parties to exercise an expanded judicial review.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",null,2019

All rights reserved.Kojic acid is an organic acid that has manifold industrial applications mainly in cosmetics, food and medicine. This research aims to optimise the production of kojic acid from sago fibre using a locally isolated Aspergillus flavus strain under solid-state fermentation (SSF). Central Composite Design (CCD) of Response Surface Methodology (RSM) consisting of 5 factors and 5 levels were employed to determine the influence of culture conditions such as initial moisture content (50-90% (v/w)), inoculum density (5-35% (v/w)), urea concentration (0.5-3.5% (w/w)), mineral salts solution (5-35% (v/w)) and incubation time (9-21 days) on kojic acid production. The results showed that the data were best represented by a quadratic model where the significant factors for kojic acid production were identified as inoculum density and incubation time with their optimal values of 30% (v/w) and 18 days, respectively. The maximum production of kojic acid achieved in this study represented a 2-fold increase from that achieved in the non-optimised conditions. In summary, this work describes the optimisation of kojic acid production from sago fibre employing RSM. In addition, this research represents a further step towards developing a sustainable production of kojic acid employing an eco-friendly and low-cost indigenous feedstock.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",21,2019

Firstly, with evaluation gird method in miryoku engineering in in-depth interview, attractive factors from Neo-Chinese home style were extracted and evaluation grid figures were built. Secondly, the compatibility between the existing range hoods and the attraction factors of Neo-Chinese style was analyzed through questionnaires to make a design strategy. Finally, the effectiveness of the design strategy was tested on the improved design of the range hoods. It was found that the most attraction factors of Neo-Chinese home style include overall harmony, elegance and retaining, composedness and tranquility, as well as its simplicity and plainness. However, the existing range hoods perform poorly in elegance and retraining and environmental adaptability. The refined design based on the evaluation grid figures can better adapt to the Neo-Chinese style home environment. The results show that the evaluation grid method can effectively establish the connection between the subjective preference of the home style and the specific design features, providing implications for the design of household products.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",4,2019

All rights reserved.The study was designed to investigate the comparative efficacy of antiprogestin vis-à-vis dopamine agonist in the treatment of pyometra in bitches (n=16) presented to the Referral Veterinary Polyclinic-Teaching Veterinary Clinical Complex, Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Izatnagar. Pyometra was confirmed by presumptive clinical signs and transabdominal ultrasonography and the positive bitches were randomly subjected to two treatment regime, T1 (Mifepristone @ 2.5mg/kg p.o. on day 0, 1 and 10) and T2 (dopamine agonist, Cabergoline @ 5µg/kg, p.o. for 7 days), n=8/group. Cloprostenol @5µg/kg, s/c on alternate days for 7 days was included in both the groups along with empirical fluid and antibiotics. The treatment responses was determined by general clinical examination, changes of blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, prostaglandin F metabolites (PGFM) and progesterone (P4) level at pre-treatment and 10 days post-treatment. Recurrence or recovery was recorded on follow up examination and telephonic feedback after 100 days post treatment. A reduction in BUN and P4 concentration was recorded in both the treatment groups. The non-recurrence rate (%) of pyometra in the mifepristone treated bitches was 85.7 percent compared to 51.43 percent in cabergoline (P=0.09) treatment. From this study it can be concluded that addition of mifepristone improved the recovery rate with a reduction of recurrence rate in the medically treated pyometra cases in bitch.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",19,2019

The aim of the present work involved the production, purification and partial characterization of intracellular (IPS) and extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) from several basidiomycete strains. Such polysaccharides were used to investigate their effect on growth of human carcinoma cell lines. Methods: Mushroom polysaccharides were produced from several basidiomycete strains by submerged and solid state fermentations, assayed for superoxide radical scavenging activity, purified by gel filtration chromatography, analysed by FTIR and their effect on human carcinoma cell line was investigated by MTT method. Results: Mushroom polysaccharides have revealed scavenging activity in the range of 22 – 81 % for Po (s) and Pe (2), respectively. FTIR analysis of polysaccharides showed absorption bands characteristics of these biological macromolecules. IPS inhibited cell growth of HeLa in the range of 16.8 – 27.01 % for Po (s) and Ga (1), respectively. EPS inhibited cell growth of HeLa, A459, A431 and OE21 in the ranges of 3.08 – 92.2 %, 13.8 – 97.4 %, 14.7 – 93. 8% and 25 – 94% for Il (1) and Ga (1), Gc (1) and Ga (1), Il (1) and Ga (1), Le (1) and Ga (1), respectively. Purified preparations of polysaccharides confirmed the growth inhibition of these biomolecules. Conclusion: The present results strongly suggest growth inhibition of human carcinoma cell lines by mushroom polysaccharides and it will require a future research to understand its molecular mechanism of action.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",31,2019

All rights reserved.One of the most well-articulated rules of international human rights law, the right to participate in politics and public life through the suffrage, is also one of the more frequently denied for individuals with disabilities. This work intents to draw a parallel, based on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, about the structural power that the right to vote and to be voted can offer to all individuals who, somehow, are daily prevented from exercising them. The article 29 of this Convention, addresses the design and implementation of an electoral process that is non-discriminatory, while also requiring states to provide voters with disability-related other facilitative measures to enable their equal rights. Sovereignty makes the rights rise in each and every citizen and allows them to participate in political decision-making and to be part of the primary element in shaping the public interest. During the research, we look more closely at the rights of minorities, emphasizing the ones connected with persons with disabilities in the decision-making process, especially the political ones, so that their rights can be heard and enforced. Throughout the study, we observed that the guarantee of the right to suffrage and its manifestations requires, previously, the elimination of architectural, social, economic and attitudinal obstacles, among others. The rules contained in the Brazilian Inclusion Law and the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities are intended to shape parameters to protect and enforce this right of citizens with disabilities and drive the expression of this minority in all its political potential. Emerging practices around the globe, as in Spain and Germany, corroborating that persons with disabilities can be successfully incorporated in all phases of an electoral process. The suffrage rights become, therefore, a channel for participation and transformation of the subservient individual to a citizen capable of influencing decisions that will be taken on his behalf.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",41,2019

The VIC is understood to be the origin and cause of the socioenvironmental crisis of this so-called Sacrifice Zone. Based on references such as Lefebvre (2013) and Augé (1992), and their approaches to the co-production of space and non-place, a multi-scale analysis is carried out that seeks to lay the foundations for the discussion and argumentation of planning based on the community and its experiences. Subsequently, a methodology consisting of a participatory workshop with members of the community is proposed that aims to identify, distinguish and characterize living in this area, in addition to the impact industrial development has had on the territory. The conclusions reveal that the existing Territorial Planning Regulations perpetuate the logic behind the development of the Sacrifice Zone. This negatively impacts the regional identity of the residents of Puchuncaví, which is validated by the community. Finally, the article opens the discussion on the need for new rationales that imply the (re)valuation -and the consequent (re)appropriation- of the territory as catalytic logics for productive proposals that diverge from that currently embodied in the VIC.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",26,2019

Since Italian dialects are sister languages of the standard variety, speakers can be considered bilingual.

All rights reserved.The linguistic discussion of 1950 is considered in the article as a “dispute” of two linguistic “paradigms” oriented to the study of language as langue and language as langage. This is demonstrated through a different understanding of the concept of language law by Stalin and by the creator of the “new theory of language” Nikolay Yakovlevich Marr (1864-1934). At the same time, a number of laws formulated by Marr (the law of “universal human thinking”, the law of opposite meanings, the law of diffuse meanings, the law of functional transfer, the law of hybridization) are analyzed, and it is argued that Marr’s view on language laws— above all, on the laws of semantics — was significantly different from the understanding of semantic laws which was accepted before him (in the works of Michel Bréal, Mikhail Mikhailovich Pokrovskiy, etc.). The main difference consisted in the fact that the laws referred to in the works of Marr, claimed the status of universal, not only in the sense that, as Marr believed, they could be applicable to all existing languages, but also in the sense that they generally went beyond linguistics, claiming to describe phenomena studied by other disciplines or “proved” with the involvement of facts analyzed by other sciences. In turn, analysis of the general context of the history of linguistic ideas that preceded the discussion (including the context of “crisis” in linguistics at the turn of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries) allows to state some differences between linguistic laws formulated for phonetics and semantics.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",31,2019

Zhurnal Vysshey Shkoly Ekonomiki,"[('PSTGU', None, 'Russian Federation')]","© 2019, National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics. All rights reserved.The article is focussed on Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoevsky’s reception of the philosophical ideas of Ludwig Feuerbach. Both writers took it as their existential mission to attempt to respond to the atheistic paradigm that had taken shape in the West in the 1840s, under the influence, among others, of “left-wing Hegelians”. Its creators’ atheistic views were deliberately cast as a natural law intimately linked with social and biological models borrowed from anthropology. The fundamental hypothesis of this piece of research is that two central ideas from German philosophy — (a) the view that religion is a projection of human consciousness, and (b) the concept of anthropotheism, one of whose main components is the maxim homo homini deus est — were reflected in the religious and philosophical inquiry of these two Russian authors, albeit in different forms and “genres”. When it comes to Tolstoy, his diary entries from the final years of his life are of particular importance, as they have an “internal transcendence” in that they capture and reflect upon religious experience in a “dynamic and labile” form. An all-round analysis and a moral and philosophical evaluation of this experience enabled Tolstoy to state that “the divine instinct” is not an anthropomorphism that emerged as the result of man projecting particular expectations onto “the Divine”, but rather an internal need that is inherent in human nature. Dostoevsky, who first encountered Feuerbach’s thought in the circle of Mikhail Butashevich-Petrashevsky, views atheism and anthropotheism as parts of an internally linked nexus of ideas that are subjected to sharp problematisation and polyphonic evaluation in the world of his novels. His overall philosophical stance is that Feuerbach’s ideas are internally contradictory and do not take into account the irrational force of evil in human nature and the existential significance of human freedom in overcoming the same.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",33,2019

All rights reserved.The eighteenth-century French philosophe Mably, in the declaration used as the title for this paper, articulated a key principle of modern “enlightened” understanding: the demand to use knowledge of the natural laws of human nature as the basis for social policy and social laws. It was the basis for utilitarian social and political thought, and it remains a commonplace of modern Western discourse. I analyse the puzzles and contradictions to which Mably’s declaration leads. I then illustrate the arguments with a case study based on Thomas Henry Huxley’s lecture, “Evolution and Ethics” (1893). In this lecture, and in other public essays, Huxley argued both for knowledge of “man’s place in nature” (i. e. for the scientific study of human conformity to the laws of nature) and the overcoming of natural conditions with moral civilisation. He made different claims in different rhetorical contexts. The paper argues this is the case for all modern Western statements about the laws of human nature detached from the conceptual roots of a belief that there are such laws in Judeo-Christian natural law theory. I emphasise this by drawing in insights from Nietzsche on the desire to “live according to nature”, that is, according to the laws of nature.

Zhurnal Vysshey Shkoly Ekonomiki,"[('HSE University', 'Moscow', 'Russian Federation')]","© 2019, National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics. All rights reserved.Nayas (Sanskrit, “points of view”), are invariably included by historians of Indian philosophy in the number of methods of reliable knowledge. But in Jainism, they have the second aim also: they serve as the effective means of refutation of the opponents of Jīna Mahāvīra’s teachings. The article presents arguments in favor of mainly polemical aims of nayas because they aren’t as obvious as their cognitive function. The author of the article sees them as the means of polemics because they are mentioned already in the most ancient parts of the Jain Canon, which were composed much earlier than a theory of instruments of valid knowledge (pramāṇavāda) appeared, and also because, according to the instructions of Jain authors, nayas complemented the teaching of changeable reality (anekāntavāda) and they were used along with the sevenfold paralogism (saptabhaṅgī) for to demonstrate the false absoluteness of non-Jaina metaphysical positions. If we would consider the totality of these methods only as a means of obtaining reliable knowledge about the changing reality, this methodology looks like an unfit tool for two reasons at least: the variability of reality, relativizing any claims about it; and the uncertainty of the methods themselves, preventing the rapid acquisition of the required knowledge. This makes it possible to see the main purpose of using the method of points of view in proving Jain thesis that their opponents do not possess the absolute truth of any objects, which implies the insolvency of their claims to possess metaphysical truth, and it is an indirect justification of Jain metaphysics.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",15,2019

All agree that negligence liability is imposed on a defendant whose unreasonable conduct caused foreseeable harm to the plaintiff, and who owed a duty of care to the plaintiff. But views differ considerably as to the meaning and role of each element (unreasonable conduct, harm causation, duty), the test and the relevant considerations that should be applied to each, the interrelation between these elements, and the meaning and role of the foreseeability requirement in each element. Against this background, the author has argued for years that the above complexities can be easily solved by a simplified model of negligence. Recently the author's model has been embraced by Israeli justices and judges. The article presents the proposed model, explains how it solves the described complexities, and fends off criticism. It then demonstrates the model's operation by applying it to the 2018 SCC's decision in the Rankin case. A glimpse at the Third Restatement on Torts shows that it steers in the same direction, as evidenced by an analysis of the Palsgraf case and the unforeseeable plaintiff question. Following a short overview of leading British cases from Donoghue to the 2018 decision in Robinson, it is argued that a shift to the proposed model would be a natural evolution that can be easily achieved. In contrast, it is argued that Canadian law has moved in another direction, for incorrect reasons. The model is then compared with another reform recently suggested in the literature. Finally, fault-based liability in continental Europe is viewed from the perspective of the proposed model.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",25,2019

Akinwumi; Licensee Neoplasia Research.Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) is a ubiquitous environmental toxicant with high exposure potential to man mainly through leaching from water and foods plastics packages. Exposure to DEHP is associated with cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and splenic toxicity. In the present study, the effect of alpha tocopherol (α-tocopherol) on the DEHP-induced alteration in hematology and oxidative injury in the spleen of male Sprague Dawley rats was investigated. Animals were exposed daily for six weeks to 5 mg/kg bd.wt DEHP and 10 mg/kg bd.wt Vitamin E either alone or in combination. Control rats were given olive oil throughout the duration of the experiment. Organ weight indices and hematology parameters including packed cell volume (PCV), white blood cells (WBC), lymphocytes and neutrophils were determined in test and control rats. In addition, malondialdehyde, superoxide dismustase (SOD), catalase and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activities were determined in the spleen. Histology of the spleen was also evaluated. Hematoxicity of DHEP was characterized by decreased PCV, WBC counts and neutrophil, while eosinophil was markedly elevated. DHEP administration resulted in oxidative stress that was manifested by elevated MDA and GST coupled with decreases in SOD and catalase activities. The spleen sections from DEHP-treated rats showed congestion and hyperplasia. However, Vitamin E modulated the hematological parameters and alleviated oxidative changes caused by DEHP exposure. Vitamin E also prevented DHEP associated lesions in the spleen. Therefore, Vitamin E could be useful in controlling hematotoxicty and splenic oxidative injury caused by DEHP intoxication.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",70,2019

Scientific understanding, intuitive expression and automatic information integration of the damage are conducive to better cultural inheritance. Although historic building information modeling (HBIM) technology has the characteristics of high correlation between model and information, and it can integrate information into the model, which is highly compatible with the requirements of the information expression integration of ancient buildings, there are still some problems in application, such as the fine division of damage model expression and the difficulty of the quick integration of a large amount of damage information. This paper takes the crack damage of ancient wooden buildings as an example. Firstly, the multi-Level of Detail (LoD) expression standard of crack model was proposed.

In order to solve the problem of the large amount of information, the secondary development of Revit was carried out by writing external commands and the software was loaded as an external application to automatically integrate and update information. Finally, the method was verified by an HBIM model of an ancient wooden building, and the automatic information integration of 64 pillars was completed within 4 seconds. It shows the efficiency and reliability of the multi-LoD expression method and information automatic integration algorithm, which can provide reference for the expression, integration and management of the information of historical buildings.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",2,2019

Firstly, seven representative painting styles, including cartoons, sketches, oil paintings, watercolor paintings, and art painting styles of Chinese pyrography, ink painting and murals, were selected as the research objectives, and the images are pre-processed by denoising and normalization. Secondly, we extracted the style features of painting images and obtain the color entropy, block entropy and contour entropy respectively.

During the calculation of the information entropy, the color space was transformed from RGB to LAB, and the image color entropy was obtained from a and b channel values and weighting functions. By dividing the artistic images into blocks, we calculated the average entropy of all the blocks to obtain block entropy. Contourlet transform was used to obtain the contour information of artistic images, and we obtained contour entropy. After that, color entropy, block entropy and contour entropy were merged and extracted, and support vector machine (SVM) was applied to train the artistic style image to obtain the classification model of artistic paintings. Finally, we extracted the entropy characteristics of the samples to be identified, and obtained the final classification results by SVM. The method proposed has the advantages of less feature dimension, fast operation and scale invariance. The experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the classification accuracy and efficiency of different painting styles.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",10,2019

This paper argues that there is a contradiction between decisions ruled by the Court resulted in the inconsistency against constitutional interpretations. Such inconsistency can refer to the decision of the Constitutional Court No. 072-073 / PUU-II/2004 declaring the Constitutional Court to have the power to decide disputes over the results of regional head elections. On the other hand, Decision No. 97/PUU-XI/2013 ruled this institution no longer to adjudicate disputes over the results of regional elections so that it revokes Article 236C of the revised Regional Government Act No. 12/2008. In doing so, this paper analyzes the impact of such contradictory decisions and how both decisions have effects on legal certainty over disputes of the regional head election. This paper concludes that the application of two different approaches caused such inconsistency: the first decision applied judicial activism and the latter considered judicial restraint.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",12,2019

Against this theoretical backdrop, accessibility is scrutinised from the perspective of aesthetics of migration and minorities within the field of the visual arts in museum settings. These aesthetic narrative forms act as modalities that encourage the diffusion of ‘niche’ knowledge, where processes of translation and interpretation provide access to all knowledge as counter discourse. Within this framework, the ways in which language is used can be considered the beginning of a type of ‘local grammar’ in English as lingua franca for interlingual translation and subtitling, both of which ensure access to knowledge for all citizens as a human rights principle and regardless of cultural and social differences.

All rights reserved.The modern culture, which justified the creation of social and human sciences, faced with the inconstancy of the laws of these sciences: they change, allow disturbing influences of individuals and, therefore, include regular exceptions and violations— what is called transgression in social theory. Unlike the usual exception to the rules, the transgression is always experienced and realized by the subject; unlike the dialectical contradiction, it does not necessarily include a development. Transgression can affect both descriptive and prescriptive laws, violating logical classifications, rules of language, social behavior of people. Its dynamic structure renders it close to the narrative — a text that integrates heterogeneous, often contradictory elements (events) in a temporal sequence. The article discusses various types of transgressive violations in science and fiction: logical exceptions (on the example of an episode of Flaubert’s Bouvard and Pécuchet), psychological estrangement (on the example of literary theories of Russian formalists), ritual transgression in anthropology (on the example of Georges Bataille’s theoretical works). Reproducing transgressive practices, literature and art develop a new form of mimesis, specifically inherent in modern culture: the reciprocal interchange of “plus” and “minus” that occurs in transgression constitutes a constant feature of modern European thought; such is a form of self-realization of the modern subject, experiencing his or her “existence” in going beyond the limits of law-abiding behavior and creativity.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",17,2019

All rights reserved.Presently, the k0-standardization method of instrumental neutron activation analysis (k0-INAA) technique has become the preferred method for multi-elemental analysis due to its high metrological value. The reactor neutron parameters (α and f) for rotary rack as well as the detector efficiency were determined and used for ko-INAA. The information is then used to compute the elemental concentration of certified reference materials (CRMs) using k0-INAA software developed in Vietnam. This results of the CRMs analysis showed the average z-score were below the threshold value of 2 with precision of about 10% for most of the element concentrations analyzed. The result has been very promising and at present stage, the laboratory is focusing on testing this method and capacity building for our staff. In future, the k0-INAA technique will be used to analyze air particulate, marine environmental samples, geological samples and archeological artifacts as well as to provide analytical services to clients from industries in particular.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",12,2019

This paper focused on a Japanese productive predicational metonymy, action for causation, and described its linguistic preference in terms of aspectual construal based on a corpus-driven quantitative investigation. The results revealed that an event that is bounded and durative is preferred as the metonymic vehicle in action for causation metonymy. The two cognitive principles, bounded over unbounded and durative over punctual, were proposed to explain the linguistic preference. It was suggested that the two principles can be subsumed under the fundamental cognitive principle of good Gestalt over poor Gestalt, and that this general principle governs metonymic preference of both predicates and nominal phrases.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",32,2019

Yet, the various meanings and interpretations of the term create the need for more specific terms that designate specific types of localization such as the cases where a locally generated website, created in a locale with ‘minor’ presence on the international market, needs to be provided in a language that is considered ‘major’ in cyberspace, e.g. websites into English as a lingua franca. In such cases, the website content transfer follows an opposite direction, i.e. from the local to the global. We would like to capitalize on the major-minor metaphor as a methodological tool for cases emerging as a quasi-opposite process to the prevailing conceptualization of localization, in an attempt to highlight differences which might justify new terminology. It will be argued that the concept of locale from which the term localization stems does not apply when a culturally undefined audience is addressed, and a new term will be proposed.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",64,2019

All rights reserved.Forensic science is the application of science in a criminal investigation or court of law. Crimes and forensic investigation have always been associated with human society. As an interdisciplinary field, forensic science incorporates areas of both life sciences and social sciences. Until the beginning of the 1900s, forensic science was self-taught and carried out exclusively through law enforcement agencies. In recent years, with the success of crime drama television series, an increased global interest in forensic science-based university courses has been observed. The prevalence of global issues such as international crimes and mass disasters has catalysed the need for international collaboration and to remove global barriers within forensic science. To prepare students for the world of work, it is pivotal that forensic science curricula address the needs of the present-day society and the requirements of the forensic providers (laboratories and law enforcement agencies). The present manuscript describes the first forensic science international curriculum between Australia (Murdoch University) and Malaysia (Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia/UKM Forensics), possible through the New Colombo Plan of the Australian Government.

Both conceptual and critical discourse analysis of the metaphors are conducted. The study finds that the way a metaphor is realized visually and verbally in a cartoon determines the features mapped onto the topic, and further implicitly expresses a critical stance toward the topic under discussion. The metaphors in the cartoons evoke a general understanding of haze problem by activating the war scenario and familiar cultural or social context in viewers. It is found in this corpus that visual fusion and visual replacement are the most frequent kinds of visual metaphors. The study further affirms that visual metaphors are better in conveying rich and implicit conceptual and affective meaning, and can be direct manifestation of the conceptual metaphor without the mediation of language.

To determine whether these groups perceive variably reduced vowels as phonologically visible, 78 listeners counted the number of syllables perceived in 280 target audio files. Linear regression models fitted to 21,436 responses indicate that English monolinguals apply an L1 perceptual strategy, but L2-Spanish learners have shifted their perceptual boundaries.

All rights reserved.This paper answers two rarely considered questions: How well do German regions exploit their potential to produce renewable energy and which factors impact on this exploitation efficiency? By applying the new quantitative-empirical concept of exploitation efficiency, we measure the degree, to which regions have exploited their natural and socio-economic potentials of producing energy from renewable source at a specific point in time. This approach allows, with respect to wind power, solar power and biogas energy, a relative comparison of regions, monitoring their performance over time as well as the identification of best-practice regions. Applying our innovative method, we compare German districts in the time period 2000-2014. We use a robust, non-parametric efficiency analysis and validate its results by qualitative expert interviews in selected counties in Lower Saxony. The results show strong disparities in terms of the exploitation efficiency between districts and federal states. This exploitation efficiency moreover varies significantly for different types of renewable energy. We also observe specialization ten-dencies in this context. Our empirical results are very detailed both from a spatial and from a temporal perspective and therefore allow for drawing several conclusions for local and federal state policies. For instance, those districts (and federal states) with currently rather low exploitation efficiencies need to learn from those with high efficiencies. Such learning effects may sustainably contribute to a successful turnaround in energy policy.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",37,2019

Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.Interim uses have played an important role in research and planning for about 15-20 years. Interim uses were previously negated or dismissed as a marginal phenomenon. Today they are considered to play a central role in dealing with the consequences of shrinking. This paper uses a contrasting comparison to explore how interim uses work in different urban contexts. It compares a continuously shrinking medium-sized city (Dessau-Roßlau) with a large city (Leipzig) that has gone through different phases over the past three decades (shrinkage, reurbanisation and growth). The result of the comparison is that urban contexts, i.e. the respective urban development phases, are decisive framework conditions for interim uses. A critical mass of interim users is needed as demanders of interim uses and a proactive attitude of city policy and administration towards interim uses. These conditions are particularly present in large cities and metropolises as well as in contexts of reurbanisation and growth. Reurbanisation or mode- rate growth after shrinkage can be seen as an optimal urban context for interim uses. From this perspective, the predominant thematisation of interim uses as an “instrument of shrinkage” seems too one-sided or misleading. The effects of interim use in a context of a medium-sized city such as Dessau-Roßlau are rather small or even marginal. Shrinking medium-sized towns and even more so small towns should therefore not be given exaggerated hopes with regard to the effects of the interim use instrument: Interim uses are not best practice for all cities.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",52,2019

The researcher conducted the study in the Emergency ward of Surakarta mental hospital for 2 months and obtained 71 total samples on patient readmission where there was a recurrent mental illness. The samples were taken using the accidental sampling technique. The data was taken using a questionnaire and analyzed using narrative description and central tendencies. Results: The results showed that the highest trigger recurrence factors were 58% related to patient compliance when taking medication. The results showed that there are various triggers for the recurrence of mental illness. Conclusion: These were evidenced by the family members who stated that they found the medication around the house or in the patient’s shirt pocket.

All rights reserved.Spatial and temporal variations in moisture conditions across monsoon Asia were investigated using 347 Monsoon Asia Drought Atlas (MADA) grid points and 100 Chinese historical documents sites during the years 1470−2000. We applied Rotated Empirical Orthogonal Function (REOF) analysis to evaluate spatial moisture variability during the past 530 years. The first 13 principal components together explained 61.35% of the total variance, with the First Principal Component (PC1) accounting for 14.1%. After varimax rotation to the first 13 EOFs, we obtained new time series and spatial patterns. These patterns divided monsoon Asia into 13 regions with coherent moisture variability. Drought events were analyzed within these 13 regions. The results indicate that there has been a prominent drying trend in eastern and central Mongolia, Southeast Asia and east China during the last 50 years. Conversely, India and the Tibetan Plateau show a significant increase in moisture around the late 20th century. We found four drought periods, A.D. 1625−1644, A.D. 1710−1729, A.D. 1920s, and A.D. 1975−1999 occurred widely across monsoon Asia during the past 530 years. On inter-annual time scales, moisture variations in the northwest region of monsoon Asia, the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia are influenced by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Thirty-year running correlation coefficient diagnostic analysis revealed that moisture variability in monsoon Asia is associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",41,2019

All rights reserved.Hydrology of the high glacierized region in the Tianshan Mountains is an important water resource for arid and semiarid areas of China, even Central Asia. The hydrological process is complex to understand, due to the high variability in climate and the lack of hydrometeorological data. Based on field observations, the present study analyzes the meteorological and hydrological characteristics of the Koxkar Glacier River Basin during 2008−2011; and the factors influencing climate impact on glacier hydrology are discussed. The results show that precipitation at the terminus of the glacier was 426.2 mm, 471.8 mm, 624.9 mm, and 532 mm in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively. Discharge increases starting in May, reaches its highest value in July and August, and then starts to decrease. The mean annual discharge was 118.23×106 m3 during the four years observed, with 87.0% occurring in the ablation season (May−September). During the study period, the runoff in August accounted for 29% of total streamflow, followed by July (22%) and June (14%). The runoff exhibited obviously high interannual variability from April to September, induced by drastic changes in climate factors. Discharge autocorrelations are very high for all the years. The climate factors show different influences on discharge. The highest correlation R between daily temperature and discharge was for a time lag of 2−3 days on the Koxkar Glacier (0.66−0.76). The daily depth of runoff to daily temperature and daily water vapor pressure had an R2 value of 0.56 and 0.69, respectively, which could be described by an exponential function. A closer relationship is found between runoff and either temperature or water vapor pressure on a monthly scale; the R2 values are 0.65 and 0.78, respectively. The study helps us to understand the mechanisms of the hydrological−meteorological system of typical regional glaciers and to provide a reference for glacier-runoff simulations and water-resource management.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",34,2019

This personification or anthropomorphization plays a crucial role in Benjamin’s analysis of the metropolitan aesthetics. The article seeks to answer why and how Benjamin sought this path in his mapping of modernity’s aestheticization and finally how it manifests itself in relation to Benjamin’s theory during the National Socialism’s aesthetics of politics and later in the digital passages of late modernity as commodity aesthetics driven by algorithms.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",30,2019

The artwork is based on some theoretical approaches from literature and animation, thematically drawing on Gaston Bachelard’s notion of vastness, built upon an analysis of Baudelaire’s poetry, and addressing spatial phobias.

Handgrip relaxation is an intervention that can be used to reduce the blood pressure in patients with hypertension. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of handgrip relaxation on decreasing blood pressure in patients with hypertension. Methods: This study used a pre-test-post-test design with a control group and it was conducted at RSUD Dr. M. Haulussy, Ambon. The sample consisted of 14 patients aged 18 to 75 who suffered from hypertension type 1 and 2. The sampling method was consecutive sampling and the patients were divided into the intervention (n=7) and control group (n=7). Handgrip relaxation was administered to the patients in the intervention group. The data was analyzed using a One-Way ANOVA test. Results: The results showed a decrease in the systolic and diastolic blood pressures on the 3rd day with the highest mean value found in the intervention group and the control group had a significance value of 0.003 (p<0.05) and 0.014 (p<0.05). Conclusion: Handgrip relaxation had an effect on the decrease of systolic and diastolic blood pressures in patients with hypertension. Handgrip relaxation that was given for fifteen minutes over three days can be recommended as a nursing intervention to decrease the blood pressure of hypertensive patients.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",16,2019

All rights reserved.Introduction: Body mass index (BMI) and physical activity are the controversial risk factors that cause hemorrhoids. This study was conducted to determine the association between body mass index and physical activity. Methods: This was a case-control study which involved two hundred and two patients using convenience sampling. They had to answer a questionnaire consisting of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) which monitored their physical activity and their BMI was also measured. For the descriptive analysis, Chi square and an odd ratio were carried out. Results: There was a significant association between age and hemorrhoids (p=0.02), in which the patients who were younger than 50 years old were more likely to have hemorrhoids compared to those who were older than 50 years old (OR=2.268, 95%CI: 1.107-4.630). For the risk estimation calculation, the Chinese individuals were found to have a higher risk compared to non-Chinese individuals (OR=2.056, 95% CI: 1.174-3.601). BMI was proven to be significantly associated with hemorrhoids (p=0.043). Physical activities were found to not be statistically significant (p=0.209). Those with a low and moderate physical activity level were 1.24 times more likely to have hemorrhoids compared to those with a high level of physical activity (OR=1.243, 95%CI: 0.697-2.217). The confidence interval was between 0.697 and 2.217, therefore it was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Physical activity was not associated with the hemorrhoids. However, it was shown that good physical activity could help to regulate bowel function and therefore, the occurrence of hemorrhoids would be less likely. BMI was significantly associated with hemorrhoids.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",14,2019

All rights reserved.Introduction: The nursing department often incurs problems about the performance of the nurses in providing nursing care at the hospital. This condition must get the attention of the head of the room as the manager who is directly responsible for the nursing care provided by the implementing nurse. Supervision is a part of the directional function that has the role of maintaining the department so then all programmed activities can be carried out properly and smoothly. Methods: This systematic review was conducted to review the effect of clinical supervision on nurse performance. For the systematic review, a literature search of the PubMed, SAGE, Science direct, and Scopus databases using the keywords ‘nursing’, ‘clinical supervision’, ‘clinical performance’ and ‘nurse performance’ was conducted in February 2019. The search identified 15 relevant research articles from the 2.436 original articles and full texts published between 2013 and 2019. Results: The results show that clinical supervision has the potential to improve staff performance, which will ultimately affect the successful attainment of the hospital. Conclusion: Support from the hospital nursing management in providing support and monitoring is critical to the continuity, sustainability and successful implementation of clinical supervision. Clinical supervision activities conducted regularly in a scheduled manner will spur on the nurse’s performance.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2019', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2019'}, 'day': '31'}",19,2019

All rights reserved.Ter, ancient Tagara, in the Osmanabad district (Maharashtra), is among the most important sites when discussing Indo-Roman relations. Local production of small artefacts, such as pottery lamps and figurines, reveals an enthrallment for the exotic resulting in new transcultural visual solutions. The shape, iconography, and execution of terracotta lamps of the so-called Indo-Roman type from Ter are a clear witness to this phenomenon. The absence of precise comparisons with Western productions, and the impossibility to connect them to a direct trade of lamps confirm the transcultural value of these lamps. They are indeed the product of intermingling and contact, not just a copy of well-known types; they are better understood as an original product of Indian manufacturers based on a current stylistic trend gathering inputs from different media and materials. The result is a syncretic original product, created to satisfy the refined taste of urban mercantile elites.

In the bloodstream of an affected subject, circulating tumor cells (CTC) and/or small deoxy-ribonucleic acid (DNA) fragments, known as “circulating tumor DNA” (ctDNA), can be found as a consequence of cancer cells’ death. Cell-free circulating DNA (cfDNA) consists of small fragments of DNA that are found free in plasma or serum, but also in other body fluids. The term “liquid biopsy” (LB) describes a highly sensitive method (based on a simple sampling of peripheral blood) for the isolation and analysis of cfDNA, which can also contain ctDNA and CTC. Its purpose is to look for cancer cells or portions of their DNA that are circulating in the blood. LB can be used to help find cancer in an early stage. It also has the additional advantage of being largely non-invasive and, therefore, being done more frequently, allowing better tumor and genetic mutations tracking. It can also be used to validate the efficacy of a drug for cancer treatment by taking multiple samples of LB within a few weeks.

The phase 3 SOLAR study confirmed better efficacy of S-1, oxaliplatin, and leucovorin (SOL) than S-1 plus cisplatin in advanced gastric cancer. Lentinan, β-(1, 3)-glucan purified from Shiitake mushrooms, has been reported to improve the overall survival of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.

This protein plays an important role in regulating the MAP kinase signaling pathway, which is involved in cellular development, differentiation, division, proliferation, secretion, inflammatory responses and apoptosis in mammalian cells. Since 2002, the mutation of valine 600 to glutamic acid (V600E) is the most prevalent, and it is found to be recurrent in many cancer types. It is frequently identified cancer-causing mutation in melanoma, colorectal cancer, thyroid carcinoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma, hairy cell leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, glioneuronal tumors, hepatocellular carcinoma, adenocarcinoma of lung, ovarian cancer, and also others malignancies and some cancer metastasis. In the early 1990s, some researchers began studying MAP kinase signaling pathway involved in controlling cell growth and its role in cancer, and it helped identify targets for new classes of cancer therapy. Later BRAF mutation was found in over 50% of melanomas. The overactive BRAF protein expression looked like an attractive drug target. Elucidating the detailed molecular structure of the mutant protein helped pharmaceutical companies developed selective inhibitors of mutated BRAF, including Vemurafenib and Dabrafenib, which have been approved to treat melanoma by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In addition, there is a growing number of targeted agents that are being evaluated to treat various BRAF-mutant advanced cancer (especially melanoma, lung, thyroid and colorectal cancer), including other RAF kinase inhibitors and/or MEK inhibitors. The standard therapy of inhibition of BRAF mutation in advanced melanoma and/or others malignancies, improved clinical benefit compared to chemotherapy. In the meantime, intrinsic and acquired resistances are still key challenges by using these drugs. The future research is heading to understand the mechanisms of the resistance, therefore it will help us to understand diseases biology and continuously bringing new therapeutic strategies for melanoma and/or others malignancies, including other drugs combination and next-generation of BRAF inhibitors.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",82,2020

Because most of these tumors don’t have any specific symptom and the majority of gastric mesenchymal tumors are gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), many are therefore misdiagnosed as GISTs. In addition, gastric schwannoma is the benign and slow-growing lesion in the stomach, but GISTs had poor outcomes due to lack of response to nonsurgical interventions. In our study, we analyzed two cases of these tumors. Computer tomography (CT), contrast-enhanced CT, gastroscopy, endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) were applied to diagnose these two patients. In addition, histological examination and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to confirm the final diagnosis. All imageological examination such as CT, contrast-enhanced CT, gastroscopy and EUS, diagnosed these two patients as gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Surprisingly, after the subtotal gastric surgery, histological examination showed that these lesions were composed of spindle cells. Those cells presenting in the bundle or fence-like arrangement were mildly heterologous. The outcomes of immunohistochemistry of the cell membrane markers (CD117/DOG-1 negative, CD34 mild positive or negative) were the exact opposite of the characteristic presentation of GIST. These pathological findings refused the primary diagnosis, and were in coincidence with the characteristics of gastric schwannomas. To our best knowledge, these tumors are really rare that only two cases could be reported and analyzed clinically. CT and EUS could hel p diagnose gastric schwannomas before pathological examination results, but in order to define this diagnosis correctly. Pathological examination and IHC staining should be applied after surgery. To avoid the recurrence, it is better to resect the lesion completely, regardless of the malignant or benign disease.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",23,2020

Our urban life which stretches over thousands of years and takes on different appearances with the processes it goes through, has experienced transformation countless times for different throughout this time. Wars, political-economic orientations and ideologies as well as the necessities imposed by nature have had an impact on these transformations. Although, the “transformation” has followed a random and unpredictable course throughout this process, mostly in its own flow, the idea of “transforming the city” has probably been visible in all ages, many times as a historical undertaking. So this study aims to reveal the early examples of “the attempt to transform the city” in Antiquity.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",32,2020

All rights reserved.Within the scope of this article, construction contracts model, which is one of the implementation models of urban transformation projects carried out under the responsibility of municipalities in Turkey is examined. In the 2000s, numerous legal regulations have been made for the regeneration or redevelopment of old urban areas in Turkey. By these legal regulations, municipalities have become actors in the field of urban transformation. However, the lack of institutional capacities of municipalities mandates them to conduct urban transformation projects in the partnership with TOKİ. As in the case of Altındağ Municipality, the number of district municipalities that take the responsibility alone in urban transformation projects is quite few. In the district of Altındağ, whose name was mentioned with Gecekondu in the past, there are 14 different urban transformation projects implemented in the last 15 years, 10 of these projects were carried out directly by the Municipality of Altındağ with the construction contracts model. By examining the interview with the units of Altındağ Municipality related to urban transformation and the council decisions, plans, projects and activity reports of the municipality, through the projects realized in Gültepe Neighborhood and Çalışkanlar Neighborhood, the positive and negative aspects of the ""construction contracts "" model as an urban transformation model have been evaluated. As a result, the effects of this model have been tried to be explained in the implementation of urban transformation policy.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",48,2020

Little is known about the development of the species, or the genetic mechanisms that may favor the establishment of populations in cultivated plants. Here, we conduct the first large-scale molecular study of C. impicticornis. Using tissues derived from the genitalia and the rest of the body for two immature stages of both males and females, we generated RNA-seq data, then assembled and functionally annotated a transcriptome. The de novo-assembled transcriptome contained around 400,000 contigs, with an average length of 688 bp. After pruning duplicated sequences and conducting a functional annotation, the final annotated transcriptome comprised 39,478 transcripts, of which 12,665 were assigned to Gene Ontology (GO) terms. These novel datasets will be invaluable for the discovery of molecular processes related to morphogenesis and immature biology.

For this purpose, gathering the theses under a single research framework is of great importance in terms of providing a helpful resource for other researchers and shedding light on other studies to be conducted on this subject. This research is descriptive research using qualitative data collection methods. The pattern of the research is the case study. When searched for the keywords violoncello or cello in YÖK Thesis, 204 theses were found. While these 204 theses constitute the universe of the research, 5 theses from these theses on the transfer of folk melodies to cello constitute the sample group. The data obtained from these 5 theses were analyzed with document analysis technique. As a result of the research, all of the studies on transferring folk melodies to cello were carried out in educational sciences institutes and music education departments. Accordingly, it was understood that the primary purpose of theses was cello education. It has been observed that the coma sounds in the songs transferred except for one thesis were simplified and arranged in accordance with the tampere sound system. It was concluded that the decision sounds of the works were generally changed for a brighter sensation.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",25,2020

All rights reserved.It is known that the foundation of the Turkish Maqam Music sound system emerged in the 13th century and that the system was used as the Systemic School. This system, the foundation of which was laid by Safiyyuddin Abdulmumin Urmevi, was developed by Abdulkadir Meragi in the 15th century and the translation of Meragi into a pen especially on music theory is considered to be a source for 15th century Anatolian theologians with the manuscripts called Camiu'l-Elhan and Makasıdu'l-Elhan. The first information can be obtained from the manuscripts of Yusuf Kırsehri, Hızır bin Abdullah, Bedr-i Dilsad, Ladikli Mehmet Celebi, one of the 15th century theoreticians/theorists. On the other hand, 'Haza Mecmua-i Saz u Soz', written by Ali Ufki Bey in the mid-17th century, is of great importance as a manuscript that includes a wide variety of Ottoman/Turkish Maqam Music instrument/lyric works and contains many works. In this context, in cases where another example can be taken, it is obliged to be contented with this information on a large perspective before the 17th century. Accordingly, it has been recorded with both edvârs and various note writing systems to be written in the 17th century and the following centuries. With the examinations made on the instrument/lyric work, the feature of melodical course can be revealed in detail. It is also known that the maqams have changed more or less over the centuries. It can be said that Ottoman/Turkish Maqam Music was in a period of development, especially with the period of Sultan III. Selim Khan This is a century as compared to the old centuries in terms of some maqams, course, transition and decision. With this research, the determination of the period when the Zirgule and/or Nim Zirgule tone began to be used as a sansibl, based on the characteristics of the makams mentioned in the 17th and 18th century instrumental/lyric works and manuscripts of Buselik, Humayun, Dugah and Hisar, which are finished on the Dugah tone. For this purpose, with the scanning model, both the written mode navigational characteristics and the saz/lyric note samples found in the manuscripts were examined, and an opinion was made about the century in which the makams changed. As a result of this research, it was found that in the 17th century, the Buselik maqam did not use the Zirgule tone both during the course and during stage the end of piece, that the Zirgule tone was included in the Buselik course with the Kantemiroglu period, but in the finishing phase was made without sansibl. During the 1750 – 1775 period, the Zirgule tone was included in the Buselik course and the end of piece was made generally without sansibl, and the first examples of the Zirgule tone began to be used as the sansibl, that the Dügâh and Hümâyun maqams started to use the Zirgule tone in the 1750-1850 period. It was concluded that the Zirgule tone was also applied in Hisar Maqam during the 1750 – 1770 period.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",18,2020

In particular, we tested the hypothesis that exposure to other varieties represents a possible source of variability in nuclear tune choice. Ten speakers from Salerno were selected and divided into two groups according to whether or not they had at least a non-native parent. Information-seeking yes-no questions and information-seeking wh-questions were elicited using a Reading Task. Results show that part of the variability found in the use of intonation can be attributed to the presence vs absence of early exposure. Specifically, such results concern differences in the distribution of tunes mirroring that of the variety to which speakers were exposed. Finally, the study highlights the need of taking into account different sources of variation when investigating a language’s intonational grammar.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",58,2020

All rights reserved.Parkinson’s disease is often associated with the hypokinetic type of dysarthria, which is characterized by movements that are reduced in both amplitude and speed. As far as dysarthric speech is concerned, these features of dysarthria have been correlated with a reduction in the phonetic space used by speakers, e.g. in vowel articulation. The aim of the study described in this paper is to investigate the production of Italian high vowels by Parkinsonian dysarthric subjects, with specific attention to both the acoustic and the articulatory characteristics of their speech, by looking at formant values, amplitude of the lingual and labial gestures as well as duration and articulation rate. In particular, the discussion focuses on the acoustic and articulatory measurements (electromagnetic articulography – AG501) obtained by recording three dysarthric subjects and three healthy controls from Lecce. Results show that, in addition to the expected tendency to reduce articulatory gestures as for both their amplitude and duration, an increase concerning measures obtained for some articulators and along some axes may also be observed. Data collected in relation to tongue and lip movement suggest that gestures are modulated to carry out compensatory strategies aimed at preserving relevant linguistic features, such as the acoustic characteristics of rounded in comparison to unrounded vowels.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",19,2020

A controlled experiment with 12 Italian students (6F, 6M) was performed in order to ascertain whether formants’ values of the three cardinal vowels /a/-/i/-/u/ will help in distinguishing the same speaker across three different recording modalities. Both unnormalized data in Hertz and normalized values (Lobanov and Bark) were compared across the male and female subsets. Results indicate that unnormalized data performed better than normalized ones, and that a qualitative investigation has to be combined with a quantitative one. This preliminary work opens the way to further investigations on the possibilities of WhatsApp audio messages for forensic purposes at the crossroads between linguistics and engineering.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",31,2020

All rights reserved.Understanding how birds utilised songs and calls to communicate among conspecifics is crucial for their survival, yet it remains an understudied area in bird ecology. We studied the influence of perch height selection on the vocalisation of Pied Triller, a common garden bird, in two suburban landscapes namely Pustaka Negeri Sarawak Recreational Park, Kuching and Universiti Malaysia Sarawak campus, Kota Samarahan from October 2018 to February 2019. Using a Marantz recorder connected to a parabolic reflector, we recorded calls and songs during morning (0630-1030 hr) and late afternoon (1600-1830 hr). Perch object, tree species, roost substrate and perch height from the ground were identified and measured. Clear and good quality spectrograms were used directly to describe song and call types. Photos and video recordings were analysed to describe perch behaviour. The vocal output representatives were then matched to the corresponding behaviour displayed. Our results revealed that Pied Trillers emit four different vocal outputs namely (i) song type, (ii) call type A, (iii) call type B and (iv) call type C. A total of nine behaviours were observed, of which the perch-hop behaviour was observed the most from both male and female Pied Trillers (33.71%), followed by perching (29.21%), foraging (20.22%), preening (7.78%), defecating (2.25%), eating (2.25%), roosting (2.25%), bill wipe (1.12%) and flight (1.12%). They prefer to roost on high perch to emit calls compared to songs. This probably suggest that Pied Triller prioritised vocal transmission and signalling to avoid being masked by surrounding anthropogenic noises and to avoid being conspicuous to potential predators. The most frequently visited perch object was the Weeping fig tree, Ficus benjamina.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",27,2020

The National Commodity Policy (2011-2020) targets to increase the pepper plantation area from the current 16,331 ha to 20,110 ha by year 2020. However, pepper diseases remain as a major challenge in the pepper industry. A great number of airborne fungi pathogen may contribute to a significant economic loss in pepper production. Therefore, this study aims to morphologically identify the diversity of fungi obtained from air-borne samples in a pepper planation that are capable of causing pepper plant diseases. This experiment was conducted at a pepper plantation near Lembah Bidong, Kuala Terengganu. An Andersen spore sampler was used to collect the fungi spores. Culture based identification were then made. The study resulted in the identification of four genus of fungi such as Fusarium sp, Fusarium semictectum Fusarium oxysporum, Curvularia sp., Penicillium sp. and Trichoderma sp. (Ascomycetes).

Even though calcaneal fractures are common among those with multiple injuries, they can easily be missed, and not treating them would significantly impact on the patient negatively. It is therefore important a high index of suspicion is made for this injury among patients involved in high-energy trauma. Case Presentation This article is a retrospective recall of the six patients seen with calcaneal fractures that were treated in our hospital between 2010 and 2018, they were mainly multiply injured and the advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocol helped to delineate these fractures, the use of modern-day operative and non-operative methods of management and rehabilitation were employed. Discussion and conclusion Calcaneal fractures are mostly associated with high-energy trauma which includes falls from heights or vehicle accidents with almost 50% soft tissue involvement. This is similar to cases presented in this paper as all the patients were either involved in road traffic accidents or had fallen from a height, however, soft tissue destruction manifesting as open fractures were absent in our series. Calcaneal fractures are rare and can easily be missed as patients may present as multiply injured.

[Methods] Ten male subjects (age 26.9±1.7 yrs, height 172.2±5.7 cm, weight 66.5±7.5 kg) who have no musculoskeletal disorder with one's upper or lower limb were selected as subjects. To analyze and compare series of muscle activity, five of surface EMG electrodes were attached to the upper rectus abdominis (URA), lower rectus abdominis (LRA), external abdominal oblique (EO), erector spinae (ES) and gluteus maximus (GM). Each subject did plank exercise on stable support surfaces (normal surfaces) and unstable support surfaces with the togu-jumper. For each dependent variable, one-way ANOVA with repeated measures were performed with significance level p<.05. Contrasts were performed to execute post tests for results with statistical significance. [Results] The study showed that the average IEMG values of URA and LRA increased in Upper (Togu-jumper used upper limb) compared to normal surfaces. This is perhaps because the effects of URA more than any other muscles for body stability. Furthermore, the peak IEMG values of LRA increased in Upper and Lower (Togu-jumper used lower limb) compared to normal surfaces. In addition, peak IEMG values of EO increased in Upper compared to Normal. This may have resulted due to momentary strong muscle activity in LRA and EO to correct body posture and balance. Therefore, using Togu-jumper on upper limb maximizes the performance of core training in plank exercise. [Conclusions] The study may be further applied to a method for effective training. It is considered that research and analysis has to be further done on modified plank exercise. Additionally, it is necessary to analyze not only global muscle but also local muscle, as a comprehensive research, to suggest ideal method for plank exercise.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': 'December 2020', 'day': '31'}",18,2020

HCT plays a pivotal role in increasing knowledge and awareness to prevent, treat, and control HIV/AIDS. The study objective was to determine the knowledge, attitude, utilization of HCT among brothel-based FSWs (BBFSWs). Method: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study among 300 BBFSWs in Lagos State. The respondents were recruited by snowballing after a multistage sampling method was used in the selection of the brothels. The data was collected using an adapted interviewer-administered questionnaire and analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 23. The level of statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Results: Majority (63.0%) of the respondents were between the ages of 21-30 years and 67.4% had good knowledge of HIV and HCT. About 75.0% had a positive attitude towards HCT and 55.6% of FSWs in this study had utilized an HCT center in the past. The main reason for not taking HIV test was the fear of a positive result (90.6%) while the main reasons given for not visiting any HCT center were lack of confidentiality (13.3%), stigmatization (14.8%), and distance to the HCT center (67.2%).

Although Non-Occupational Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) is a safe and efficacious method of HIV prevention, it remains an underutilized prevention strategy in Nigeria. This study aimed to determine the awareness level of nPEP after sexual and other non-occupational exposure to HIV among undergraduate students of a private University. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted among 395 undergraduates’ students. Data was collected by pre-tested structured self-administered questionnaires. Data obtained from the study were analyzed using the IBM SPSS Statistics version 20 software program and Frequency distribution tables with percentages and cross-tables were used for data description. Results: About 42.8% were aware of nPEP. Most of the respondents 361 (91.4%) knew that PEP is to be given after HIV exposure risk following sexual intercourse. Although 79.5% of the respondents indicated that they will see their physician after unprotected sexual intercourse and other non-occupational exposure to HIV, the majority neither knows about nPEP initiation time, 247 (62.5%) nor its duration, 286 (72.4%). Conclusions: A low level of awareness was observed among our study participants, therefore, consistent health education and promotion of nPEP will improve its awareness, uptake, and possibly reduce the prevalence of HIV among our youths.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",31,2020

[Methods] Primary and secondary data were used to understand the integration process of the three organizations. [Result] First, immediately after liberation, the Korean Sports Association was reorganized and a number of new sports organizations were founded. Second, in the 1960s, the military regime exerted the government's control, making all social groups essential to register in accordance with the Act on Social Group Registration. Third, the Korea Olympic Committee and the Korean School Sports Association frequently caused friction as they operated overlapping projects with the existing Korean Sports Association. Fourth, in February 1968, the government consolidated three groups that were considered social issues based on the experience of dissolving the Korean Special Sports Association. Fifth, the integration of the three organizations is significant in that it prevented redundant projects and wasted budget, and resolved the discord in the sports world. [Conclusion] The first integration of the Korean Sports Association in 1968 was a historical event that absorbed the Korean Olympic Committee and the Korean School Sports Association. The integration of the three organizations is viewed as a solution for the systematic operation of the sports administration, but on the one hand, it has become the top-ranking organization in the Korean sports community since this time by well blocking the checks of the Korean Olympic Committee and Korean School Sports Association. It can be understood as maintaining absolute power.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': 'December 2020', 'day': '31'}",36,2020

After contextualizing the subject, I review two specific texts that criticize Foucault: Can the Subaltern Speak? by Gayatri Spivak, and Necropolitics by Mbembe. From the first, I extract the general idea that the right to look is the opposite of the right to “see without being seen”. From the second, I deduce an opacity and invisibility management function that the necropolitics exerts in conjunction with biopolitics. Finally, I argue that, if all “seeing” depends on “not seeing”, the right to look demands a position that is always to be built.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",37,2020

All rights reserved.The major purpose of this quantitative research is to investigate the frequency of social learning strategies used in teaching German as a foreign language within the population of primary school students of the higher grade (corresponding to the age of 11 to 14). Furthermore, the aim of this study is to explore the statistically significant differences between pupil’s gender, age, second language performance assessment as predictors and social learning strategies as dependent variables. The research was done during the first semester of the school year 2019 / 2020 with 218 students. The modified questionnaire Strategy Inventory for Language Learning designed by Rebecca Oxford, Likert and Guttman scale were used for data collection. The Cronbach’s Alpha reliability coefficient of the modified scale was a = .89. The research data was analysed by a quantitative method with IBM SPSS 23 and the results revealed that the primary school learners employed social learning strategies with an average value of 3.30, which represents a medium frequency of use. Results have shown that female students tend to use social learning strategies more frequently than males (Mf = 11.05; Mm = 9.74) and their usage becomes less intense with age (М5 = 4.14, М6 = 3.69, М7 = 2.42, М8 = 2.39). Performance assessment is not contributing significantly to their frequency (rho = .18, p = .39). The Mann - Whitney U test is used to compare whether there is a statistically significant difference in the dependent variable for two independent groups: Students in late childhood and students in early adolescence. Results have shown that the second group of students use rarer social learning strategies than the first. Therefore, older learners were exposed to the strategies input. The Wilcoxon signed - rank test was used to compare repeated measurements on a single sample to assess whether their population mean ranks differ. Results have shown that strategies input contributing statistically significant to the detected changes in a date caused by strategies input (z = - 5.24 , p = .01). The slight difference between arithmetic means (М1 = 3.22; М2 = 3.36) was explained with the Affective filter hypothesis Stephen Krashen developed in the 1980s. This paper points out the importance of using social strategies in teaching and learning German as a foreign language. Pedagogical implications refer to some important indicators of social learning strategies - symmetrical and complementary interpersonal communication and the use of cooperative learning principles in the classroom.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",26,2020

All rights reserved.Context: Rabies remains a public health challenge in many parts of the world with over 90% of human rabies cases worldwide attributed to dog bites. In India the annual incidence of dog bite is 1.9%. The study was conducted to analyse the distribution of dog bite cases as per time, place and person. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was conducted between Jan-2016 and Dec- 2017. A total of 228 victims of dog bite were interviewed. They were selected using systematic random sampling technique. Data was analysed using SPSS. Spot maps were prepared. Results: The proportion of adults being bitten by dog was more than that of children. Most of the bites occurred after evening hours. There was similarity in the place of residence and place of occurrence of bite in 81% of the cases. A statistically significant association was seen between the type of occupation and place of occurrence of dog bite. Conclusion: Epidemiological mapping of dog bite cases gives more insight to understand the problem and aids in planning control measures against occurrence dog bite. Most dog bites occurred at hours when the man dog interaction was highest. The individuals working in outdoor type of occupation are at high risk for dog bite.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",13,2020

This research was undertaken to study physiological changes of pregnancy and prevalence of various pregnancy specific and non-specific dermatoses. Methodology: A retrospective study was conducted at the dermatology out-patient department of a tertiary care center in western India and data of 308 pregnant patients presenting with dermatoses, in the age-group of 19-35 years was analyzed. Detailed history, clinical examination and necessary investigations were reviewed. Results: Among 308 patients, 302(98.05%) presented with physiological skin changes of pregnancy, 118(38.31%) had pregnancy specific and 185(60.06%) had pregnancy non-specific dermatoses. The most common physiological change was pigmentary changes (n=294). Atopic eruption of pregnancy (n=79) was the most common pregnancy specific dermatoses followed by polymorphic eruption of pregnancy (n=38). In non-specific dermatoses, infectious diseases were more common (fungal, n=128; viral, n=25). Conclusion: Pregnancy non-specific dermatoses were seen more commonly than pregnancy specific dermatoses. Lower socioeconomic strata and overcrowding may be the reasons behind large number of infectious dermatoses that we saw in our study.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",13,2020

Constructing Narcotic Addiction and Its Treatments in the United States (1870-1920),Journal of Somaesthetics,[],"© 2020, Aalborg University press. All rights reserved.The nature and management of narcotic addiction, and by extension, the nature and management of those who struggle with it, are not recent issues in the United States. Despite the current opioid epidemics and the apparent discovery of prescription-drug addiction, medical treatment of opioid dependence is already more than 100 years old. Is compulsive drug consumption a vice? A disease? A lifestyle? How does it affect the minds and bodies of those who suffer from it? How can they be cured? In the 1870s, physicians were already struggling with such questions when they pioneered what would become known as “addictology” in the 20th century. This article first endeavors to retrace the emergence of the conceptualization and perception of opiate addiction in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. From “imported vice” to “unhealthy lifestyle” and finally “nervous disease”, narcotic dependence became an increasingly important source of concern for turn-of-the-century physicians, precipitating a rapid and sometimes dangerously disjointed medicalization. This study then explores the different facets of early addiction treatments, their philosophies, their views on “addicted bodies” (particularly through the lens of lifestyle and heredity), and their impact on the evolution of addiction management programs.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",68,2020

All rights reserved.The article considers the problem of the methodological difficulties of the work of historians with visual sources of Old Russia. Its relevance is determined by the paradoxical epistemological situation that has developed in historical science as a result of a visual turn. Historians who are researching Old Russia and constantly experiencing a shortage of sources could significantly expand the source base at their disposal, but they traditionally do not appreciate the information potential of ancient Russian art. The article analyzes methodological ideas related to the problems of “decryption” and interpretation of information from Russian and European medieval visual sources contained in the works of structuralism (Lotman, Uspensky), specialists in the field of iconography and iconology (Panofsky, Gombrich), symbolic history (M. Pasturo), source study methodologist Lappo-Danilevsky. The species and historical features of this type of sources create serious difficulties for historians, require the development of a methodology for working with “unrealistic” images, but also open up prospects for a meaningful enrichment of research. Russian and foreign science has accumulated sufficient theoretical and practical experience in this area. Therefore it is hoped that research on the visual sources of Old Russia will expand and take its rightful place in the corpus of historical knowledge.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",29,2020

Studies on menopausal issues and health demand priority in the Indian scenario due to the growing population of menopausal women as a result of their increased life expectancy. Materials& Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a predesigned, structured questionnaire based on socio-demographic variables and menopausal symptoms as per the MEN-QOL questionnaire and administered by the investigator. Postmenopausal women coming to UHTC were selected purpos-ively until the sample size was reached and interviewed. Data collected were coded and entered in an Excel sheet. Values were expressed in the form of frequency and percentages. Results: The mean age at menopause was 48.8 years. Most frequent menopausal symptoms were aching in muscle and joints (72.9%), feeling tired (65%), poor memory (61.4%), lower backache (49%), and difficulty in sleeping (54.3%). The vasomotor and sexual domains complained when compared to physical and psychological domains. Conclusion: The age at onset of menopause in an urban area of southwestern Maharashtra is 48.8 years which is four years more than the mean menopause age for Indian women. The most frequent menopausal symptoms were aching in muscle and joints, feeling tired and poor memory.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",19,2020

All rights reserved.Stress is one issue that affects the health and well-being of every building occupant. The negative effects of stress are more pronounced in workplaces, where stress can act as a major agent of disease and an impediment to em-ployee productivity and satisfaction. The underlying causes of occupational stress are varied and include job insecu-rity, extended hours, excessive workload, altercations within the organization, tight deadlines, changes in responsi-bilities, and lack of autonomy, among others. One of the factors that can contribute to overall occupational stress is the working environment itself—a factor that can be mitigated by design. While occupational stress may arise from a multiplicity of causes, designers have numerous interventions they can employ to decrease it. The literature on occupational health, well-being, satisfaction, and productivity is broad and multifaceted; however, this paper is limited to exploring stress factors that correlate with the built environment and focuses on employees who are experiencing a high rate of stress in office buildings as the target group. To address these issues, supporting literature was explored to identify environmental interventions that could reduce stress or enhance the stress-cop-ing abilities of workers in offices by improving the environmental quality of the built environment. This article explores the following questions: How does space cause people to experience mental stress? In what ways can the built environment itself be a generator of stress? What are the main environmental factors in offices that can mitigate the stress levels of employees or help them to recover more easily from work-related stress? To answer these questions, it is necessary to understand the causes and mechanisms of chronic stress, including work-related stressors, and to identify the factors in the built environment that can be associated with occupational stress. The present paper is based on concurrent analyses of supporting literature in the rather different fields of architec-ture, public health, psychology, management, and environmental studies. The outcome is an identified set of prac-tical strategies that provide solutions for healthier and more productive workplaces. By concentrating on measures that can reduce employee stress levels, these strategies can be used as a source for evidence-based workplace de-signs.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",78,2020

Schemes are commonly used in teaching to illustrate the theoretical material but, as the article shows, they can also serve as an effective research tool since they are verbally concise, visually accessible and systemically organized. Schemes help researchers highlight the aspects that are crucial for understanding the nature of a given phenomenon and reveal the key structural, functional and causal relationships. The potential of schematization as a research method is illustrated by the authors’ own experience of modelling the structure and processes of human capital formation in an industrial city. Modelling brings to light the specific characteristics of diferent stages in the transition from traditional to industrial and post-industrial society. Modelling is based on the assumption that each historical period has its own socio-demographic profle, which can be summarized in the notion of human potential. Each period is characterized by specific scenarios of human potential being transformed into human capital or quasi-capital. Our study uses models in the form of fowcharts supplied with descriptions. The models help us conceptualize the historical analysis of human capital formation in an industrial city during modernization. They prove to be particularly useful for addressing the tasks that constitute the frst stage of a historical study.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",48,2020

Current clinical and epidemiological data are insufficient to understand the full extent of the transmission potential of the COVID pandemic. The main advantages are that it can identify potentially infected individuals before severe symptoms emerge, and if conducted sufficiently quickly can prevent onward transmission from the secondary cases. Hence the study was undertaken. Methodology: It was a cross-sectional study conducted by the Department of Community Medicine, Bhopal from 9th May to 30th June 2020. Results: Out of 426 COVID positive patients, 54.93% were asymptomatic and 45.07% symptomatic. Fever was the most common presentation reported by the COVID positive patients. Mean incubation period was 4.68 ±2.63 days. Contact with COVID-19 positive cases was major source of infection identified. Only 9.86% patients had co-morbidity. Out of 10512 contacts traced, 66.65% i.e., 6902 samples were collected. Overall Positivity rate was found to be 4.30%. The positivity of the advanced contact tracing is 2.42%.

Both systems of control respond to risks and dangers to society, taboo through ideas of contagion and biopower through normative, especially medical discourses by authorized instances of knowledge production. They are reflected also in the audio-visual popular culture seeking to make sense of suicide through entertaining and artistic means. The two films I study present suicide as a contagion that has supernatural (Bird Box) and social origins (Bridgend), and as a force of nature that threatens individuals from the outside yet also from within as madness (Bird Box), or as irrationality or vulnerability of youth (Bridgend). By analyzing suicide's representation in both films, I discuss the ways western thinking trying to fathom voluntary death reflects senses of danger attached to suicide under taboo and biopower and in response to the humane emotions of love and fear of loss. I also discuss how taboo and biopower can be seen to generate this threat to individual lives by their suppression of living and dying.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",65,2020

All rights reserved.The article is devoted to the analysis and comparison of theories of moral intuition, actively discussed in epistemology and cognitive science in the first two decades of this century. At the beginning of the twentieth century intuitionism was a popular position in ethics. However, already in the middle of the last century this position was rejected by philosophers. At the beginning of the new century, we can see a return of interest in the study of intuition and its role in ethical decision-making. The main disciplines in which there is an increase in the number of studies of moral intuition are primarily cognitive science and epistemology. Approaches to the phenomenon of moral intuition in these disciplines are different. Cognitive science, moral psychology, is primarily focused on understanding intuition as a psychological process characterized by a specific cognitive role. Epistemology is interested in moral intuition as an epistemic state, in what role it plays in justification of our knowledge of moral facts. However, despite the fact that moral intuition is understood differently in these disciplines, we can nevertheless highlight common points. The paper notes that the revival of interest in moral intuition is associated largely with the development of research in the field of decision theory, namely the development of a theory of ethical deci - sion-making. Another area of research, with which the study of moral intuition is closely related, is the problem of moral uncertainty.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",53,2020

The Russian language has the status of a state language, but, given the large number of ethnic groups living on the territory of Russia, it must not jeopardise other national languages, as this could lead to inter-ethnic conflicts. Some of the key issues Russia is currently facing in this field are: The process of globalisation, the uncontrolled penetration of anglicisms into the Russian language, the adverse impact of the Internet and social networks on literacy, especially with the younger population. All valid rules of the Russian orthography are, in fact, prescribed by the Government of The Russian Federation. Laws regulating the area of language policy are the Constitution of the Russian Federation, the Law on the Languages of the Peoples of the Russian Federation, and the Law on the State Language of the Russian Federation.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",6,2020

All rights reserved.The Divine Child was introduced by Carl Gustav Jung as an archetype closely linked to the process of individuation. Beyond the realm of analytical psychology, this peculiar child figure has been observed in myths and folklore and eventually evolved into a literary archetype known alternatively as das fremde Kind (the strange/alien child). Numerous child figures have since been regarded as representations of this archetype, with the titular character of Michael Ende’s novel Momo (1973) being one of them. While her initial appearance is evocative of the Divine Child, over the course of the story Momo has to accept her fate as the chosen one in a battle against a mysterious foe, ultimately finding herself in the role of the hero of the story. This paper examines the traits of both the archetype of the Divine Child, as well as that of the Hero - including a variation specific to child characters - with the goal of reconsidering if Momo is truly exemplary of the archetype of the Divine Child. This is done with particular regard to Christopher Vogler’s observation that literary archetypes are character functions, rather than fixed types, and as such this paper will discuss how Ende’s protagonist is ultimately an example of this fluidity of functions.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",32,2020

All rights reserved.In its attempts to defend the right of women to claim their own subjectivity, as well as the equal right to participate in the social system institutions, the mainstream of feminist thinking has been marked crucially by the question of woman and her identity. This question could be said to occupy a central place in feminist texts and discussions which started even before the women’s movement was officially created. But since feminist disagreements about how these issues should be approached appropriately have already resulted in serious misunderstandings and mutually severe accusations, this paper aims at shedding light at the very nature of these polarities. In doing so, the focus has been placed on how the terms equal and different have been theorised. These dissenting voices have certainly proved productive in the context of theory itself, but have done much harm in the domain of social activism which failed to initiate truly substantial changes within western society and culture. The same countereffect is also visible in theory, which has generated a diversity of feminisms, but has definitely failed to offer a comprehensive critique of the perniciously repressive culture. The lack of gender equality has always been an important dimension of this culture, but still just a segment and one particular mechanism of the invisible matrix which has never actually stopped producing binary hierarchies. They are being manifested in different forms today but have retained fundamentally unchanged and unchallenged structures, promoting an ideologically induced perception of reality to appear natural and self-evident. The paper puts forward the claim that a humanistic and anti-capitalist feminism is a framework broad enough to overcome all exclusions and one-sided definitions and to head towards one such comprehensive feminism - bringing us back to the original radicalism of the women’s movement. To do so, it is necessary to reconsider the general confusion within postmodernist discourse, and especially the controversy related to what humanism should stand for today.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",24,2020

All rights reserved.This paper attempts at examining and determining, using the vast corpus of Serbian and German languages, whether the part of speech in question exists as such in each of these languages, as well as whether it (adverb) is a universal or specific language category. The research shows that most languages recognise the adverb as a distinctive part of speech, which implies that it is a universal category that can be defined according to the following criteria: A) morphological (adverbs have no flexions, but they undergo comparison with regard to the relative subclass) and syntactic (conditioned by verbs as nucleus, assuming in most cases the function of adverbials as verb complements; b) rare attributive function before nouns and adverbs themselves; c) differences between specific languages, German and Serbian included, are a result of their respective word formation systems. In this particular case, each of the two languages recognises relatively few simple words (simplizia); on the other hand, the explicit (suffixational) derivation is largely productive in Serbian, whereas there is a completely opposite situation in German concerning this issue (although the process is recorded in the latter as well); and, finally, adverb derivatives in Serbian correspond, as a rule, to adjectives and prepositional phrases functioning as adverbials in German.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2020

All rights reserved.This paper analyses the works by Branko Milanović, generated over a period of almost forty years, dedicated to the analysis of various aspects of Ivo Andrić’s literary oeuvre. Milanović is one of the most qualified interpreters of this oeuvre, given the fact that he was among the first scholars within the scope of the Yugoslav literary science to have produced a PhD dissertation on Andrić and to have published a book on his works. There are several thematic issues that mark Milanović’s prolonged interest in this matter, centred around Andrić’s literary beginnings, the atmosphere and nature of his early works, his narrative pieces featuring questions of artistic expression and the essence of art, as well as around the foundations of Andrić’s poetics, revealed in his literary works and essay and critical writing, and, finally, his novels. This analysis shows that Milanović, as early as upon acquiring his PhD title, embarks on a unique, argument-based interpretative path, constantly juxtaposing Andrić’s fiction and non-fiction. Gathered in one place, Milanović’s writings on Andrić confirm him as being one of the foremost interpreters of the latter’s oeuvre.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",21,2020

All rights reserved.Bakhtin’s views (1980:127-130) on the importance of studying speech representation and its interaction with authorial context incited prolific research in various disciplines. The research presented in this paper is based on Bakhtin’s crucial claims about speech representation, and on the theoretical framework of linguistic stylistics (Kovačević 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015; Katnić-Bakaršić 2001) and representology (Kovačević 2015:253-254). The aim of this paper is twofold—to identify the types of speech, thought and writing representation employed in the novel Sense and Sensibility and to describe their interaction with the authorial context. The method applied is‘word by word’ analysis, where in the first stage the modes of speech, thought and writing representation are identified; in the next stage their interaction with authorial context is described. The modes of speech are classified and differentiated by combining the classifications of representation modes in Serbian and English (Leech and Short 2007; Semino and Short 2004; Kovačević 2013) The results of the analysis prove that Jane Austen employs the following modes to repоrt speech, thought and writing: Indirect speech/thought/ writing, narrator’s report of speech act/ thought act/writing act, expressive indirect speech/thought, free indirect speech/thought, direct speech (monologue, dialogue, polylogue), free direct speech, line of dialogue, fragmental quote, hypothetical speech, direct thought, free direct thought, direct writing, embedded speech/thought. Predominantly, the line of interaction between authorial speech and direct speech involves the former being parenthetically embedded into foregrounded direct speech, amalgamating with the free indirect thought/speech or having as an attachment a”package” of different embedded modes of speech/ thought/writing representation. Primarily indirect thought, free indirect thought, direct thought, and free direct thought are the modes employed to characterise Elinor Dashwood, while on the other side the modes of direct speech, free direct speech, free indirect speech and direct writing combined with numerous mimetic markers prevail in depicting her sister Marianne. It is through the stylistically effective transitions between these modes and their interaction with the authorial context that the total antithetical effect regarding the sense and sensibility principles is obtained on the syntactic-stylistic level.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",32,2020

All rights reserved.Two tasks are posed in the article: First, to pay attention to the productivity of applying the activity approach in specific research and design practices of the 60‒70s of the XX century, and secondly, to analyze the possibilities of implementing the interdisciplinarity methodology in them. The sources and application of the activity approach developed in Soviet philosophy and psychology are examined, its modern criticism is given. The experience of developing interdisciplinarity is analyzed in projects implemented on the basis of the system- activity approach of E.G. Yudin for organizing ergonomic research and development, as well as formulated by E.V. Ilyenkov ideas about the activities and the emergence of consciousness on the example of the Zagorsky experiment. The fact that ergonomic studies of the second half of the last century became an experimental basis for both the study and design of activities, and the development of interdisciplinary practices is justified. The interdisciplinary interaction between philosophers, psychologists and teachers in the process of the Zagorsky experiment influenced the refinement of philosophical concepts of the nature of the ideal, its subjective forms and, in general, human consciousness The productivity of organizing special interdisciplinary research, projects and developments based on the implementation of an activity approach with the participation of specialists from different fields of knowledge studying a person is substantiated. The problem of interdisciplinarity, its origins, and modern ideas are discussed. The content of the concept of projectivity as an orientation towards the search for innovative solutions in uncertain situations, the ability to set goals, model and design a new reality is analyzed. It is concluded that interdisciplinarity and projectivity can be realized both in a strictly organized project or study, and in a communicative space in which the goals and objectives for all participants in the dialogue are not clearly formulated.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",24,2020

All rights reserved.Lexical transfer, ie the influence of the student's knowledge of a word of one language on the knowledge or use of words in the target language is an important cognitive process in learning a new language students often use as a compensation strategy. This paper deals with errors in the interlanguage of L1 Serbian students learning two typologically similar languages: Italian and Spanish, which arose as a consequence of lexico - semantic transfer. The most frequent errors caused by lexico - semantic transfer were identified and classified by the method of error analysis. An extremely large number of cases of lexico-semantic transfer were found in the corpus. All errors are classified into five categories: Loan translations, semantic extension, cognates or false friends, hybrids and complete language shifts. In all cases, the negative lexical transfer occurred with words that are similar in Italian and Spanish. The errors in the written production in Spanish did not originate from the typologically distant, although the most dominant language of the students - Serbian as L1, but from the typologically similar Italian as L2. This proves the hypothesis that in typologically similar languages, lexical transfer is the most common and also that the factors of language distance and psychotypology are the key linguistic factors that will cause the transfer. Moreover, this kind of transfer was mainly used as a compensation strategy that students relied on to fill lexical gaps in situations where they did not have sufficient knowledge of the target language. Among the lexical errors, the largest number concerns cognates or false friends and hybrids. On the other hand, examples of loan translations or calques and semantic extensions were not frequent, so we conclude that the transfer of form (lexical transfer) is more frequent than the transfer of meaning (semantic transfer).","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",35,2020

First, the corpus is processed for the purpose of quantitative comparison of figurative expressions, then 18 related words from each dictionary are singled out in order for qualitative similarities and differences to be more thoroughly examined, with, finally, the same words being analysed by means of general two-way dictionaries. The highlights of the analysis are as follows: The number of marked figurative expressions is disproportionately greater in the dictionary intended for both elementary and secondary school students; translation equivalents are identical or very similar in both school dictionaries, with the exception of the way they are marked; both school dictionaries feature examples for all figurative meanings; and, the number of figurative meanings in school dictionaries is lower than in general dictionaries, but the former show more consistence with regard to their marking and exemplifying. As far as the results are concerned, they are interpreted through the prism of lexicological, lexicographic, and didactic factors. In the end, the author conclude(s) that an appropriate treatment of figurative expressions is one of the key reasons why two-way school dictionaries are still an indispensable tool in foreign language teaching.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",30,2020

All rights reserved.The article provides insight on methodological tools of post-nonclassical science from existential perspective using the example of such concepts as value-target regulations and emergence. The main goal of the article is to expand the philosophical analysis of these methodological tools by studying their transformations in the digital age. The article considers four dimensions. Firstly, it exposes the existential projection of post-nonclassical concepts. Secondly, it defines the features of value-target regulations in relation to the semantics of purpose and value. Thirdly, the article reveals the specifics of the value system transformation in the digital age. Fourthly, it analyzes the concept of emergence in the context of contemporary realities. The author identifies significant vectors of transformations in value-target regulations, among which are the priorities of technosocialization and developing digital skills; Big Data technology development and datafication. “Double updating” patterns, simulated info-presentation and multitasking characterize behavioral digital transformations. Mental transformations are based on the expanded capabilities of brain, due to the existing trends of integration with intelligent systems. The author comes to the following conclusions. Firstly, the existential projection of post-non-classical methodological tools consists in the need for a reflective analysis of goals in relation to values. This helps to bridge the gap between the logical-conceptual abstractness of methodological tools and the problems of human existence. Secondly, at present, when digital technologies are becoming the structural element of modernity, their implementation requires active subjectivity aimed at discovering the true meaning of events and affecting the use of technological innovations. Thirdly, in spite of the fact that emergence effect is inevitable, value-target regulations contribute to the introduction of “strategic reason”, humanitarian priorities and initiatives into life practices.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",34,2020

All rights reserved.This paper gives a brief theoretical review of conceptual metaphors with special reference to the metaphors in scientific discourse because they are present in engineering and scientific texts. The author tried to use the theoretical framework of conceptual metaphors to detect and identify metaphors and mappings in the corpus consisting of engineering texts in English. The texts were selected according to the needs of students at the Academy of Professional Studies Šumadija, Department in Trstenik. A few bilingual and online dictionaries in the field of science and technology were also used. Although the corpus under consideration is rather small in comparison with other corpora containing millions of words, a considerable number of metaphorical expressions were discovered. All these expressions were grouped and analysed in order to establish conceptual mappings and metaphors. The results show that most of these conceptual metaphors have an anthropocentric quality in common (e.g. MACHINE PARTS ARE PARTS OF THE BODY, PARTS OF A MACHINE TOOL ARE PARTS OF THE BODY, A MATERIAL FEATURE IS A BODY FEATURE, A MACHINE FEATURE IS A HUMAN FEATURE).The paper also aims to apply these findings in the classroom activities. This can be achieved by raising metaphoric awareness of students learning engineering English. If students’ attention is explicitly drawn to the relations between the source and target domain, language learning can be facilitated. Thus, the study of metaphors can become a significant tool in the classroom in order to help students learn both technical and academic vocabulary and comprehend engineering texts written in English. Language acquisition may be higher if pedagogical potential of conceptual metaphors is used.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",25,2020

The aim of the paper is to identify the elements of popular culture in the novel and thus determine the nature of possible relationships in a patriarchal, capitalist society. The theoretical framework used in the paper is Fiske’s theory of popular culture (2001) and the analysis is based on regarding the characters as representatives of dominant and resistant forces. Men and the upper class constitute categories which are dominant in the relationship with subordinate ones - women and the lower class. In addition, the protagonist Rob is the prototype of a man who is subordinate to himself, i.e. to his representation of ideal male traits he lacks, according to his own beliefs. The subordinate put up resistance in different ways. Laura is a successful business woman who possesses a strong character, which places her into a better position than that of Rob.

All rights reserved.The goal of the paper is to demonstrate Orwell’s society as a panoptic one, employing all of the elements of Jeremy Bentham’s Panoptical model, as well as presenting it through Foucault’s conception of the shift from punishment to discipline as stated in Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison. Panopticon will be presented not as a model of a prison as it was initially intended to be, but as a concept which can be applied to the entire society. The two types of power, the power of sovereignty and disciplinary power shall be applied to the novel with the aim of finding parallels between the two mentioned systems, as well as some possible contraditions and deciding which system is in place in Nineteen Eighty-Four. Constant surveillance, establishing routines and controlling activity will be discussed in terms of mechanisms for gaining and maintaining power. Hate is seen as another mechanism for establishing power and one of the key emotions implemented in group psychology of a totalitarian regime. We shall discuss the role of the collective and the individual in power relations and the way they form”collective individualism” - a society in which one may notice both a unity of the group and an isolated individual.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",13,2020

Management of young infants with serious bacterial infections and the need of lumbar puncture (LP) is controversial unlike neonates and older children. Objective: to determine magnitude of meningitis and associated factors in young Infants admitted with suspected sepsis in Addis Ababa. Methods: Cross sectional study was done in young infants admitted to a tertiary center from 2013-2019 for suspected sepsis. Data was abstracted from patient files using structured questionnaire and analyzed by SPSS-20. Logistic regression was used to determine associated factors and independent predictors of meningitis. Results: A total of 230 infants were included with a male to female ratio of 1.2. Most (61%) presented with fever, respiratory symptoms and feeding intolerance. While 3/4th of them have LP performed the prevalence of meningitis was 17 %. Microbiologic tests were rarely used for etiologic diagnosis. Less than 5 % had confirmed bacterial meningitis, mostly gram-negative bacteria. Conclusion: Meningitis is common coexisting condition in infants with Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) despite low microbiologic confirmation. Complete septic work up with emphasis on microbiology should be the standard of care for all young infants with SIRS.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",26,2020

All rights reserved.The dissolution of marriage has not always existed in the French legal field since marriages were under the control and influence of the Catholic Church for a long time. It was only in 1792 that the term divorce first appeared in French law in order to designate the concept of the dissolution of civil marriages abstracted from the prerogative of death of one of the spouses and religious issues. After the introduction of this concept into the French legal context, there were legislative changes regarding different divorce situations over the following years. In the light of these facts, this paper examines the semantic and lexical evolution of the term divorce in the domain of French law, relating this evolution to socio-cultural and historical aspects of France between 1792 (when the divorce was instituted in the country) and 2017 (when the most recent legislative change on the subject occurred). The present study is based on the theoretical and methodological assumptions of Terminology (Cabré, 1999; Barros, 2004; Krieger & Finatto, 2004), particularly on the perspective of Diachronic Terminology (Dury, 1999; Tartier, 2006). Based on the results of this investigation, it is possible to affirm that the evolution of French society has leaded to the transformation of the legal domain that, in turn, has created new concepts that caused the semantic and lexical evolution of the terminology designating types of divorce in France since the eighteenth century.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': 'December 2020', 'day': '31'}",35,2020

All rights reserved.The original translation of the Old Church Slavonic biblical texts as it is known, in particular the aprakos, psalms, and apostles, was modified in Moravia, although it has not yet been investigated to what extent. A certain number of lexemes were probably taken from the West Slavic languages. Although there is no evidence of contact between Croats and the Moravian mission in historical sources related to the oldest Cyrillic period of Slavic literacy, it can be assumed that this influence occurred after the expulsion of Slavic students from Moravia, if not earlier. Among other things, this is confirmed by the preserved Moravisms in Croatian Glagolitic texts, that is, words that are archaic in the canonical Old Church Slavonic texts. Most of them appear in our older manuscripts, fragments, missals and breviaries: dr(e)vle, drьkola, uedriti, ešutь, mьša, mito, natruti, raspeti, rêsnota, siko, sьnьmь, šui etc. Some of these lexemes also appear in the Second Beram Breviary: drev’lê, dreselь, drkola, kokošь, pastirь, pênezь, derivatives of the root rêsn-, etc. Although the issue of lexical moravisms in Croatian Glagolitic monuments is not completely systematized and defined, the author presents a list of possible moravisms in the Second Beram (Ljubljana) Breviary, with an analysis of their meaning. The paper also explores the difference in the number of moravisms between the 1st and 2nd parts of the breviary and the relationship between this layer of lexemes in this manuscript and the oldest Croatian Glagolitic fragments.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",35,2020

All rights reserved.Two printers of Croatian origin, Andrija Paltašić in Venice and Dobrić Dobrićević (Boninus de Boninis) in Verona, were among the first to publish printed editions of the Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary: Paltašić 1478, Dobrićević 1481. Dobrićević’s edition is the first known woodcut- illustrated edition of printed book of hours. Later on, he published three more illustrated edi- tions of Virgin Mary’s Office in Lyon. This makes his contributions to the history of books of hours printing more significant than those by Paltašić. Dobričević’s four office editions (1481, two in 1499, and one in 1501) consistently reflect the Italian and French traditions in terms of their content, iconography and visual art. The Verona edition is in complete correspondence with the Italian tradition, while the French tradition is reflected in his Lyon editions. The brevi- aries modelled on the French tradition are more extensive in their content compared to the Ital- ian ones. They contain a larger number of New Testament texts and accompanying illustrations from the lives of Jesus and Mary. This makes the artistic, iconographic and decorative value of the French editions much more significant than that of the Italian editions. In this paper special attention is given to a copy of Dobričević’s Office from 20 March 1499, printed on parchment, which originates from Emmanuele Cicogna’s collection and is currently kept in the Museo Correr Library in Venice. Seeing as the copy had been damaged, Cicogna (according to his own handwritten notes on the inside cover) added pages and images from another copy of the same edition printed on paper, which is currently kept in fragments in the National Library of St Mark’s in Venice. The parchment copy from Cicogna’s collection provides a unique testimony of the interactive relationship between office users and its illustrations. Notably, some of the images have been partially erased due to frequent touching and, presumably, devout kissing. The most worn out pages are the ones containing the most popular prayers to the Madonna: Obsecro te and O intemerata, which contain an image of Mary with baby Jesus in her lap; a page containing a depiction of the Crucifixion on Golgotha; and one containing an illustration of Saint Apollonia, the patron saint of those suffering from toothache. Additionally, the figure of Satan was systematically erased in images depicting the Temptation of Christ. In this way, the devout user could express his anger against the tempter, just as unsophisticated observes in churches did by defacing his images in frescoes or covering them in derogatory words. Thus, Cicogna’s damaged and supplemented copy points to the forms of practical devotion that the Office was used for.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",46,2020

All rights reserved.The advent of the digital age has had an enormous impact on the way we research, teach and think about language ([23]:1). In digital humanities, the application of computer-assisted methods can facilitate investigation of corpora, (i.e. digitised samples of language in use), lead to discoveries barely detectable with the naked eye and help put interpretation by intuition to test. Such methods can also assist in investigation of the language of single texts and make our close reading more effective. This article aims to suggest how we may investigate the narrative voices in a work of fiction through the program Wmatrix ([30]). The case study under analysis is Conrad’s Bildungsroman The Shadow-Line, A Confession (1917), a. story revolving around a young inexperienced sea-captain who, dtiring his first command of a ship, has to overcome a series of difficulties to accomplish his mission. In this work, the neat division between the I protagonist-narrator’s internal world and the external adult world he has to confront lends itself to investigation of the first person and other personal pronouns in the whole work. Given that stylistic analysis of literary texts is fundamentally a comparative process, I am here interested in comparing the target text. The Shadow-Line to two comparison texts by the same authot. The keyness statistics for the pronouns and their detailed analysis through concordances will contribute to placing the I-voice at the centre of the narration and to identifying the foregrounded patterns of pronoun use that convey the I-voice and the other narrative voices throughout the story.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",38,2020

All rights reserved.Biomass fuel is the most important form of renewable energy in many parts of the world including Bangladesh. Its extraction is considered as a leading cause of forest degradation of developing countries like Bangladesh. Its consumption, collection and preference patterns are thus very important indicators of overexploitation of forest. On the other hand, forests are meager in mainly northern region of Bangladesh. Reliable data and information are scanty on biomass fuel in Bangladesh, particularly in formulating its proper management plan. The aim of this study was to conduct a comparative study on the aforesaid patterns in forest and non-forest areas of northern region of Bangladesh. The study was carried out by adaptive multistage random sampling technique. A total of 90 households (45 from forest area, 45 from non-forest area) were selected randomly and based on the monthly income the households were categorized into rich, medium, poor groups. The consumption of biomass fuel was found to be differed significantly between forest (2.10 kg/capita/day) and non-forest (1.71 kg/capita/day) area. Forest, market, agriculture, homestead and roadside plantation were identified as sources of biomass fuel, and the contribution of each sources varied significantly between the areas except market. In forest area, maximum amount of biomass fuel was collected from nearby forests (44%) and poor households collected 78% of biomass fuels from the same sources. In non-forest area, roadside plantation (31%) and homesteads (24%) were the major sources of biomass fuel, and poor households collected biomass fuel mainly from roadside plantations (75%). Stems, branches, leaves, agricultural residues and cow dung were used as biomass fuel in both areas but the consumption of each biomass fuel types varied significantly except leaves. Women were identified as major biomass fuel collector and most of the biomass fuel was found to be collected during morning to noon in both areas. Most commonly used fuelwood species was Shorea robusta in forest area and Eucalyptus camaldulensis in non-forest area. The findings of this study will help policymakers to take steps in halting deforestation as well as meeting the villager’s needs for biomass fuel.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",32,2020

Such appeals to gods’ concerns provide insights for understanding religious cognition specifically and the evolution of religious systems more generally. Here, we review case studies to this effect, and introduce the “god-problem problem”: to the extent that gods are concerned with local socioecological problems, which criteria does a problem need to satisfy in order to become an object of supernatural attention? We offer some preliminary solutions to this puzzle, which leads to a related, but often-overlooked, question: granted that features of religions may culturally evolve to adaptively fit to and resolve aspects of the local socioecological environment, what are the psychological processes through which this adaptation could occur? We wager that in order to answer the question satisfactorily, contemporary evolutionary approaches need to work together. Psychologically, the socioeco-logical environment provides the initial impetus for a belief or practice by increasing the cognitive salience of a corresponding local problem and its costs. This increased receptivity makes such ideas and corol-lary behaviors easier to learn and transmit along the routes posited by dual-inheritance theorists. Behaviors feed back to beliefs and can offset the costs of social life in a variety of ways. As such, examining how cog-nition, social learning, behavior, and ecological pressures inform each other is especially crucial for understanding the persistence, diffusion, and evolution of religious ideas and practices.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",116,2020

All rights reserved.Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is a medical imaging technology widely employed in brain region positioning for its non-invasiveness and high spatiotemporal resolution. However, the traditional FMRI signal separation algorithm was too complex and time-consuming to effectively apply the FMRI technology to brain function research. Aiming at the computational complexity of traditional FMRI brain separation algorithms, a blind separation algorithm was proposed based on the second-order Hadamard transform. This algorithm first calculated the correlation function of the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in the fMRI data, and then performed eigenvalue decomposition to obtain the unmixing matrix, thereby realizing the activation of brain regions. Given the composition of the Hadamard being only 1 or -1, the complexity can be reduced for the BOLD signal correlation matrix calculation. The simulation results show that compared with the independent component analysis (ICA) of high-order statistics and the Fourier transform blind separation algorithm of second-order statistics, the calculation time of this algorithm was only 25% and 50% of theirs, respectively, while the positioning error was close.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",13,2020

A hyper-chaotic encryption algorithm was proposed for plaintext associated images. The algorithm employed hyper-chaotic systems with more complex dynamics as a chaotic sequence generator, expanded the key space, and utilized a diffusion-scrambling-diffusion encryption framework. The method performed three-stage processing on the image, of which the depth diffusion improved efficiency using fewer iterations. The scrambling algorithm eliminated the correlation between adjacent pixels in the original image by disturbing the pixel positions. The experiment analyzed and compared the key space size, algorithm efficiency, and anti-plaintext attack capability. The simulation results show that the algorithm has not only larger key space and higher operating efficiency, but also strong plaintext sensitivity, thus effectively resisting differential attacks with great potential for secure communication applications.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",17,2020

From an extrajudicial point of view its significance is reflected in the influence on the judiciary, which will not only be effective in its procedural activity, but also in the level of trust and social prestige. It holds that the three arms of the state – the executive, the judiciary and the legislature – should, to a greater or lesser extent, be kept separate. That way, they are able to hold one another to account. This theory about the separation of state power went on to have a formative effect on the development of modern-day democracies. And it’s this vision of the tripartite separation of state power that is essential to the EU’s argument against the Polish reforms of the judiciary. The problem of supervision over administrative courts is also connected with external and internal independence of the judiciary. External independence refers to freedom from undue outside pressure, while internal independence protects individual judges from undue pressure from within the system. “Undue internal pressure” sometimes comes from court presidents and may take different forms: even where individual judges are not formally subordinate to court presidents or other authorities and may be result of attribution of workload, allocation of resources and benefits, disciplinary powers, powers of transfer and secondment, distribution of cases, etc. The aim of this paper is to examine the problem of supervision over administrative courts in legal system of Poland. The article focuses on the dependence between the model of administrative supervision and the efficiency of the courts.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",62,2020

All Rights Reserved.Emergency medical service (EMS) forms a sub-category of the internationally recognized right to health. However, despite the codification of the right to health in various human rights conventions which have been implemented in national legislation, EMS still seems to be regarded as an economic expense or a political decision rather than a legal norm or a human right. This paper evaluates the causes for such a misunderstanding, primarily through Scandinavian Legal Realism which emphasizes the social contextualization of law. Supplementary scholarly views, as well as a history of human rights, are also applied to support the main arguments. Essentially, the paper claims that the challenge of recognizing EMS as a legal norm is associated with the relatively abstract and impersonalized nature of emergency care.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",88,2020

All Rights Reserved.An important event that once again brought to the forefront issues related to mass surveillance was the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (hereafter referred as CJEU) delivered on July 16, 2020 in the case of Data Protection Commissioner v. Facebook Ireland Ltd. and Maximilian Schrems (Schrems II). It can be considered as the first serious precedent in the field of surveillance, which is aimed at ensuring privacy in the field of national security. Therefore, it becomes an important issue to assess its impact on the legal framework of international transfers of personal data and on the level of privacy protection. The impact of the judgment on the level of privacy protection and mass surveillance is particularly important now that CОVID-19 contact tracing programs are being widely used. In this research we try to trace the formation of the approach to mass surveillance in the case-law of CJEU before and after the Schrems II. We also try to point out some of the difficulties that the process of cross-border data transfer will face after the Schrems II. The main question of the study is whether the approach of the CJEU developed in the Schrems II will actually increase the privacy protection against mass surveillance. We conclude that the Schrems II is an important decision with serious consequences that go beyond the direct impact on data transfer between the EU and the US. It can have controversial influence of the level of privacy protection. Together with the positive trend of formation of more harmonized global data protection standards it can create many unresolved problems in the field of international data transfer and in economic dimension.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",34,2020

It is also wrong to question the subjectivity of human embryo using various criteria of growth (developed nervous system, brain, consciousness, participation in the life of society and looking after one’s own interests). For these criteria do not define humanity but describe human being in various phases of expressions of his/her human nature. That is why it is not acceptable to make the right to life conditional on the stage and degree of the actualization of humanity.

All rights reserved.Filamentous fungi relatively easily disperse and colonize a variety of substrates, inhabiting various, often extreme environments. Therefore, they spread all over the world. The purpose of the research was to determine whether the propagules of filamentous fungi brought (accidentally transported) into the Antarctic biome by tourists and members of scientific expeditions are capable of developing at low temperatures. In the studies were used seven isolates of fungi: Penicillium sp., Aspergillus flavus, Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Trichoderma viride, Geotrichum candidum and Botrytis cinerea. The isolates came from samples collected from tourists and members of scientific expeditions arriving at the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station on King George Island in the South Shetland archipelago. Fungal growth was measured at 0, 5, 10, 22°C (as a control) and 10° C, but after having frozen inoculum at-15°C for a period of 7 days. Penicillium sp., Alternaria alternata, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Trichoderma viride, Geotrichum candidum and Botrytis cinerea were found to be capable of growing at low temperatures (5 and 10°C as well as after one freezing cycle, down to-15°C and thawing, up to +10°C). They did not produce a macroscopically visible mycelium at temp. 0°C, however, it was not a lethal temperature for them, as when they were transferred to higher temperatures, they continued to develop even after a fairly long time following the beginning of the experiment. The most vulnerable was Aspergillus flavus. At lower temperatures (from about to 5°C) it did not develop, while freezing and thawing were lethal for this species.

All rights reserved.In Poland, afforestation is usually carried out on the weakest soils, excluded from agricultural use and wasteland, i.e. post-agricultural land. A characteristic feature of such habitat is poor-quality soil, relatively high content of nutrients for trees, par-ticularly nitrogen, as well as a low level of humus. This is important for the quality of microbiological processes occurring in post-agri-cultural soils. Restitution of the forest in such a habitat requires the use of various revitalisation treatments for improving soil quality and increasing biological activity and soil fertility. This article presents the results of a long-term experiment on the effectiveness of various revitalisation treatments (zoo-and phytomelioration) on afforested post-agricultural lands after more than 30 years from their application in pine forests in north-western Poland. These treatments consisted of introducing additional organic matter into the soil in the form of bark and sawdust, sowing lupine and introducing soil fauna. The comparative area for afforestation on post-agricultural soils in the presented experiment was the area of forest soils, located in the same habitat, in a pine stand, at the same time. Biological activity of soil was measured with the activity of soil enzymes dehydrogenases and acid phosphatase, the biomass of microorganisms was measured and the content of total dissolved carbon and nitrogen was also determined.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",44,2020

All rights reserved.Richard Butler’s Tourism Area Life Cycle (TALC) model proposes a specified view on the qualitative changes in the number of tourists N in the area over time and the environmental, social and economic processes taking place there simultaneously. N changes follow S-shaped curve up to stagnation phase. Such a course was adopted in the TALC model, assuming that the tourist population at this stage develops in accordance with a logistic model derived from ecology. This work aimed to recall the properties of the logistic model and the ecological assumptions underlying it, and some of the consequences of incorporating the logistic model into the TALC model. An attempt has also been made to link other TALC aspects with ecology. In particular, reference is made to the graph on the right side of the logistic equation of the TALC model as a function of N with the phases of evolution of the tourist area marked, which reminds that the most attractive area is the original area, i.e. when N is small, as it is characterized by the highest per capita growth of the tourist population. According to this figure, as N increases, there is a linear decrease in attractiveness despite the investments introduced according to the TALC model scenario, i.e. they do not reverse this trend. The same diagram can be used to show some elementary differences between ecotourism and mass tourism. The issues of population regulation were also raised, including the density-dependent self-regulation, the Allee effect, the concept of environmental capacity and r and K strategies. It was also pointed out that the experience gained in the field of population modelling in ecology could help to model tourist populations.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",50,2020

All rights reserved.Over the last few decades, we have witnessed a significant change in human mentality and attitudes towards the natural environment and its protection. This change is accompanied by different axiological principles within which we can distin-guish: 1) the anthropocentric concept which places man in the centre and grants him a privileged place amongst other species; 2) the anti-anthropocentric concept which stresses the equality of all species and demands a reversal in humanistic orientation consolidated by the European Enlightenment; 3) the moderate anthropocentric concept which underlines human’s caring and a responsible role towards the ecosystem. As disturbances of ecological balance are the result of human actions and the sign of the cultural crisis, the necessity to protect the natural environment should be realised. John Paul II was a supporter of the above. He referred to the integrated ecology, which combines the protection of the natural environment with the concern of the quality of human spirituality. Integrated ecology poses two demands: 1) all actions towards environmental protection should be under-stood as means of confirming the respect of human personal dignity; 2) those actions which harm the natural environment and threaten man should be given up.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2020

A self-purification process involves the disposal of pollutants entering the water from the catchment of the river. A measure of the Vistula River water purification process of organic matter is the amount of oxygen that is consumed by the beach settlement. That is the amount of utilised organic matter by psammon during cellular respiration.

Such discipline, without any doubts, is environmental protection. This science indicates methods and economic instruments that can be applied in economic practice necessary for environmental protection. It deals also with problems related to economic studies of implications of environmental policies. At the same environmental economics that results from neoclassical trend of economics looking at the market as unfailing mechanism of economic regulation proves that invisible hand of market fails in case of environmental protection. That is why we should apply different types of instruments especially these related to indirect regulation (including such economic instruments as taxes) that support actions related to limitation of environmental degradation. It is worth also to add that recognition of methodological premises of this science supports not only development of this discipline but first of all it shows that it is applicable. The principles developed by environmental economics should be applied in practice by all participants of economic life from consumers and to producers and governments in order to keep not only current natural resources but most importantly ensure the development opportunities for next generations.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2020', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2020'}, 'day': '31'}",19,2020

Shannon-Weaver diversity index, Sørensen’s index of similarity and Maturity index were also calculated. The results show that the nematode community in the soil of arable field differed from that on the fallow in respect of density and trophic structure. Nematode density was higher in the arable soil than in the fallow. The group of bacterial-feeding nematodes was the most numerous among five trophic groups recorded in the study. The higher density of that group in the arable soil than in the fallow indicates the positive response of bacterial-feeding nematodes to the higher nutrient supply after the manure applying. The results show that in three years of fallow nematode communities became more mature and diverse than in the arable soil.

Humans strive for satisfactory life of appropriate quality, and often have to make choices between various goods. Unfortunately, ecological properties are very often treated last of all in the decision-making hierarchy, and are usually considered inferior to, for example, material prosperity or social comfort. Treating the ecological properties as such, often results in them going unnoticed overall, and very soon leads to permanent and negative changes that directly affect human life and the environment, as well as having a negative effect on health. Therefore, such extraordinarily essentiaconditions for choosing and fulfilling ecological needs as regards first-class existential needs that have a vital influence on the quality of life and ecological awareness, are based chiefly on understanding the rules of sustainable development. Should the development of civilisation be ruled by economy, or should the basis of that development be protection and maintenance of natural environmental resources?

This study aims to explain the adaptation to the use of technology in the Darul Ulum Pesantren in Kudus and how the position of the Pesantren Kyai after the use of technology. The research method used is a qualitative research method through the process of data collection, data reduction, data presentation, conclusion, and data verification. Search data using interviews, observation, and documentation. The object of this research is the Pesantren program related to the application of technology and the communication process of Kyai with Pesantren residents. The findings of this study state that Darul Ulum Kudus Pesantren is conducting an adaptation process to technological advances by approaching education, digital literacy, and the virtual Qur’an. Pesantren utilizes Whatsapp, Facebook, Instagram, and Youtube. This causes the existence of Pesantren outside to be better, meaning that more people know and know about the programs Pesantren. However, it causes a decrease in the sacredness of the Kyai for his santri. Kyai becomes dialogic and democratic rather than authoritarian. This research implies that Islamic boarding schools that choose to adapt to technological developments will change the authority of the Kyai. But the Kyai also has the authority to make his Pesantren adapt to technology or reject technology.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",32,2021

Different concentrations (4-8% by weight) and different particle sizes (75-50 µm) of PKA and drilling bentonite were added to the prepared samples. Three different applications were made within the scope of the study. In the first stage, PKA was evaluated directly as a drilling mud additive based on its rheological and filtration properties due to its clay content. In the second stage, samples with the same concentration as bentonite, which is widely used in drilling applications, were prepared and evaluated. In the third stage, it was evaluated that PKA could be an additional additive material to the drilling bentonite. In the scope of the study, the usability of PKA for waste recycling investigated. ccording to the analysis results, PKA caused an increase of 2.38% on sludge weight. It provided a 112.5% increase in apparent viscosity in proportion to the concentration. There was an increase in plastic viscosity by 66.6% in 75 µm particle size and 33.3% in 50 µm particle size. With the amount of 4% additive for the Yield Point, it increased 3.5 times between 8% and reached 0.4392 kg/m2. In gel strength analyzes, there was no effect for 10 seconds gel strength.

This gap in understanding impedes effective use of zakat funds for community improvement. Therefore, this study aimed to find out the challenges faced in implementing zakat management as a deduction from taxable income of Muslim communities in East Java and propose how to tackle them. A qualitative approach was used, focusing on analyzing phenomena in their natural setting. To get a comprehensive analysis of phenomenology related to the zakat management mechanism, data collection techniques, including observation, interviews, and documentation, were used. The results showed that the management of zakat as a deduction from taxable income involves zakat through official organizations recognized by the Government, including BAZNAS (National Board of Zakat) and LAZ (Zakat Collection and Distribution Organizations). Once the muzakki fulfill their tax obligations, they receive a zakat Payment Receipt (BSZ) that can be attached to the Tax return (SPT) when paying taxes. As a result, the taxable income is directly reduced by the actual amount of zakat paid, which can lead to tax savings. Low awareness of zakat payment, reluctance to pay zakat, and lack of complete trust in BAZNAS and LAZ organizations were the challenges encountered in implementing zakat deductions. Other challenges include a limited number of BAZNAS/LAZ organizations that are recognized by the government, insufficient socialization and education on Law No. 23 of 2011 regarding zakat management, less significant tax reduction, and differences in interpretation when calculating the deduction of taxable income on zakat income.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",11,2021

To achieve this aim, the methodology used is normative legal study with statutory, contextual, case-based, and comparative approaches. Furthermore, the legal sources utilized consisted of both primary and secondary legislation. The results obtained from this study showed that rehabilitation for incarcerated military personnel involved in narcotic crimes corresponds to an endeavor aimed at providing exceptional rehabilitation specifically tailored to their circumstances. It is also important to note that the urgency of rehabilitation is closely related to the vested interest of the military in continuing the rehabilitation process, aligning with the initial recommendation. The state should, hence, give careful consideration to the implementation of specialized medical and social rehabilitation programs for military personnel who have been convicted of narcotic crimes. It is of utmost importance to establish a comprehensive framework within military agencies to facilitate the execution of medical and social rehabilitation measures for military members involved in narcotics offenses, including the necessary funding. In conclusion, the imposition of specialized rehabilitation measures, in conjunction with imprisonment, is essential for military personnel that are convicted of these crimes before their reintegration into society.

The analysis is in the form of descriptive qualitative. The criminal sanctions for perpetrators of corruption in Indonesia as stipulated in the corruption crime law are only in the form of imprisonment and fines. Thus, there is a need for reform of criminal law, specifically criminal law for corruption. These legal reform efforts sometimes originate from living laws besides Islamic law, including customary law as law that was applicable in Indonesian society before the entry of the Dutch criminal law.

All rights reserved.Objectives. During acute infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, myocardial involvement has been de-monstrated; it is unknown if cardiovascular sequelae in patients recovered from this infection and if these are associated with global morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to compare myocardial deformation in patients recovered from mild SARS-CoV-2 virus infection with healthy con-trols. Materials and methods. This was a cross-sectional observational study that included 33 subjects recovered from mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, who were diagnosed in the previous three to six months, and 31 healthy volunteers, both groups free of cardiovascular risk factors. The study of myocardial deformation was performed using echocardiography with the speckle tracking modality. Clinical and an-thropometric variables were compared. Results. The 2D global longitudinal strain of the left ventricle was lower in the subjects recovered from mild SARS-CoV-2 infection than the controls (-20.2% ± 2.6 v-21.6% ± 2.4; p: 0.036). Both groups presented differences in the three ventricular levels, significant at the apical level (-21.2 ± 4.0 vs-23.4% ± 4.2; p: 0.044). The effect by levels shows an inverse Takotsubo pattern. The left ventricular ejection fraction was preserved in both groups (p: 0.153). Conclusions. Left ventricular myocardial deformation is affected in subjects recovered from mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, while the ejection fraction was found in normal ranges. Our study shows a potential role of global longitudinal strain in the detection of subclinical myocardial alterations in patients who had SARS-CoV-2.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",15,2021

All rights reserved.Judea is a geographical term generally used to mean the Jewish region or the Jewish country. The origin of the term is based on the name of the tribe of Judah, one of the twelve tribes of Israel. The term mentioned, which is an ethnic term in origin, became a geographical and administrative term after the division of the Kingdom of Israel (United Monarchy) in about 930 BC. So that with the division of the Kingdom of Israel into two, the Kingdom of Judah (Mamleket Yehudah) was established on the lands that form the southern part of this state. Thus, the term, which is a tribal name, corresponds to a geographical and administrative usage. This name is mentioned as Ioudaia and Iudaea in Greek and Latin sources. This usage has continued in ancient history after the term Judea has turned into a term that corresponds to a geographical and administrative meaning. Even in the historical process, in continued to be used as a geographical term under the Persian (Achaemenid), Hellenistic and Roman administrations. In the 2nd century AD, under the Roman rule, the official use of this term was discontinued for political reasons. However the term of Judea, in 20th century, came to the fore again when the modern state of Israel started to use the name Judea and Samaria Area for the region called the West Bank. In this study, the emergence and use of the term Judea in ancient history, the boundaries of the geographical region covered by the term and the change of these borders are examined.

All rights reserved.This work deals with the performance of a heterojunction with intrinsic thin layer solar cell by sputtering silicon on p-type crystalline silicon substrate in argon ambient without hydrogen addition. This first effort was an attempt to use cost-effective means to convert light into electricity and to find fabrication processes which use fewer and cheaper materials for the fabrication of solar cells. Since transport mechanisms of amorphous silicon/crystalline silicon heterojunctions are still under investigation, the aim is to examine the behavior of the fabricated samples under electrical and optical constraints. Initial cell characterization includes electrical behavior via current-voltage characteristics and optical investigation via reflectance and absorptance measurements. Results are analyzed in a tentative to follow the absorption, generation and collection processes in the fabricated cell. The heterojunction interface is found to be a limiting factor in the cell performance. Under sun illumination, the open circuit voltage was 140 mV, the short circuit current was of 6 µA and the fill factor was of 42.56 %. Dark current-voltage characteristics indicated a tunneling and/or recombination carrier transport mechanism, while aborptance/reflectance measurements showed a generation process occurring in most in the crystalline silicon-side of the amorphous/crystalline silicon heterojunction. A carrier collection limitation is a very probable origin of the decreased cell generated current.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",24,2021

All rights reserved.Photovoltaic (PV) have the potential to become a major source of renewable energy and clean electricity to provide a significant share of electricity demand. However, there are several challenges that need to be addressed prior to the widespread adoption and utilization of PV technologies. The power converters commonly used between renewable energies and the grid. The inverter, which is the key for the PV integration, are still not capable of advanced control features that enable the full control of PV systems. New techniques under development make it possible to improve the performance of inverters by ensuring the correct integration of photovoltaic systems taking into account the characteristics of the grid. Hence, requirements for the advanced control of the inverter connected to the grid allow the complete control of the photovoltaic energy supplied, while ensuring a good quality of energy, a low Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of the currents injected into the grid and the control of active and reactive power. This paper presents the configurations, the classifications and the topologies of the different PV inverters connected to the grid. A concise summary of the control methods for single-phase and three-phase inverters is also presented.

The use of Banki-Michell turbine (B-M) in small hydropower constitutes an attractive solution for rural electrification in developing countries and off-grid applications. This robust turbine is easy to design and to construct and not expensive. A test bench (JLA 29) for remote applications was installed at the Aero-Thermo-Mechanics Department of the Brussels Polytechnic School of ULB to test this type of turbine. This paper aimed to present the efficiency results of the installed Banki-Michell turbine test bench for remote applications and these results helped to design a typical turbine adapted for remote sites such as the Ryamukona site located in Burundi. Two series of B-M turbine tests were carried out, by varying the flow rate using the turbine control valve opening placed inside the distributor and also by controlling the turbine speed using a Sinamics S 120 drive. The efficiency of the turbine varies between 40 and 60% for a flow range varying between 15 and 20% of the nominal flow. According to the tests made with a discharge above 20%, the efficiency of the turbine can reach easily 75 %. Based on this turbine efficiency, a typical B-M turbine of an electric power of 79.5 kWe turbine was designed for Ryamukona site which is a remote site located in Burundi.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",21,2021

All rights reserved.This article examines the struggle of the Palestinian minority over its question of social identity and political equality within the borders of the settler-colonial order of the State of Israel. While the Palestinian minority was an integral part of the fabric of Palestinian society, it became an isolated minority whose physical, cultural, and political ties were severed from both Palestinian and Arab societies with the establishment of the State of Israel. Therefore, the Palestinian minority defined itself with the Palestinian/Arab cultural identity remained beyond that border on the one hand, and with the official Israeli identity on the other. Furthermore, the Palestinian minority were besieged in every respect and meaning by the Israeli military rule and its perception of a threat to its national security. In this process, while the Palestinian minority continued its search for a collective social identity, the State of Israel pursued policies of dividing, subordination, and isolation. The Palestinian minority was isolated not only from Palestinian/Arab society but also from Jewish community. Its lands were seized to provide settlements for Jewish immigrants, who also perceived their Palestinian neighbors as potential threats to their security and permanence. However, some events on regional and global scales have had decisive influences on both multi-identity definitions of the Palestinian minority and the related policies of the Israeli State. Accordingly, the Palestinian minority sought to define itself with a correct and collective identity, and call for its rights within the borders of the State of Israel. However, this multi-identity definition of the Palestinian minority was reflected in its political representations. A political spectrum emerged, ranging from the Arab secular-nationalist to Islamist and communist political discourses. This article, hence, initially explores the social collective identity formation of the Palestinian minority and then its call for political equality under the settler-colonial regime of Israeli State.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",34,2021

All rights reserved.Orders which were used as one of the awarding tools of diplomacy of 19th century were widely used by the Ottoman Empire as well as all over the world. Ottoman orders, which emerged in the modern era in order to be more effective in diplomacy and increase visibility, took on a standard shape and identity in the middle of the 19th century and began to adorn the chests of officials at various levels of the bureaucracy. In this direction, Order of the Medjidi, which was created for the first time with its regulations, started to be given to low-level and provincial officials, persons to whom status is to be ascribed, and those who has benefited for the state. In Jerusalem, which was directly centralized to The Ministry of the Interior (Dahiliye) with the status of independent mutasarrıflık (district) in 1872, civil servants, notables and other notable persons were also awarded with both the Order of the Medjidi and the other orders like Order of the Osmani, which were created later. While orders were given to civil servants and soldiers in a certain hierarchy with standard procedures, orders were sent to the notables of the city, foreign consuls and non-Muslim community leaders for special reasons and considering their positions. In the period between 1872-1917, the number of orders sent from Istanbul to Jerusalem district were very few in some periods, while in other periods were being able to quite intense. The reasons for this change in the number of orders according to the periods were directly proportional to the central policies. The number of order procedures were affected from changes of sultan, warfare and regional policy changes. In fact, in case of Jerusalem, the profiles of the governors who were sent there late Ottoman Period also affected the increase in the number of orders. Because, the orders sent to the provinces were often sent upon the request of the governors and with the approval of the central authorities. Beginning from the second half of the 19th century, the orders sent from the center to Jerusalem with increasing numbers were aimed at increasing the loyalty of both the officials and the important people to the state. The central government, which wanted to be more visible in Jerusalem and its environs in the late Ottoman Empire, effectively used the order awards for these purposes.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",34,2021

All rights reserved.The construction of government houses in almost all Ottoman cities, small and large, in the last quarter of the 19th century is a fact that directly related with the reorganization of administrative structure in provinces during the process of the development of modern bureaucratic state. The government houses of the Tanzimat Period were completely different from the structures of the previous period, which were named as ""pasha gate"", ""governor's palace"" or ""governor's mansion"". These buildings might be considered as concrete proofs showing that the Ottoman provincial administration has begun to be depersonalized and that the patronage and protection system has turned into a professional bureaucracy. Moreover, it is worthy to note that government houses were seen as symbolic power centres that reminded the Ottoman subjects the political and administrative power of the sultan and the supremacy of the state. As a matter of fact, although some of them were modest in size, these buildings had always been given importance by both the central government and the local government due to their symbolic representative character. In this study, the government house of Jerusalem, which may be considered as one of the first buildings of that kind in the Ottoman provincial cities, is evaluated regarding its urban location, its relationship with the urban residential and commercial areas; its functional features and the structural changes in the building from the 1850s to 1917 are examined as well. The construction of a new government house in Jerusalem, which has become an important agenda item in urban politics since the 1900s, has been subjected in order to explain the relations of the urban notables with the local and central government and their activities in the city. In this context, issues such as the functioning of the bureaucracy between the imperial center and the provinces, the domination of central government over local administration, the dependency of the Jerusalem governors on the central government were evaluated.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",25,2021

We study the boundary value problem for singularly perturbed integro-differential equations with the phenomena of the so-called boundary jumps, when the fast solution variable becomes unbounded at both boundaries. The exceptions of the qualitative influence of integral terms on the asymptotic behavior of the solutions for singularly perturbed integro-differential equations are shown. The presence of integral terms will significantly change the degenerate equation: the solution of the assumed singularly perturbed integro-differential equation does not tend to the solution of the usual degenerate equation, obtained from the supposed equation with the zero value of a small parameter and will tend to solve a specially modified degenerate integro-differential equation with an additional term called the jump of the integral term. Boundary and initial functions are defined; their existence and uniqueness are proved. On the basis of the constructed boundary and initial functions are obtained analytical formula and asymptotic estimates of the solution for the integral boundary value problem. It is established that the solution of the considered boundary value problem at the ends of a given segment has the phenomena of boundary jumps of the same orders. A modified degenerate boundary value problem is constructed, to the solution of which approaches the solution of assumed singularly perturbed integral boundary value problem.

We investigate spectral properties of the problem for the nonlocal ordinary differential equation Ly (x) ≡ −y′′ (x) + εy′′ (−x) = λy (x), −1 < x < 1. Here λ is a spectral parameter, |ε| < 1. Such equations are called nonlocal because they have a term y′′ (−x) with involutional argument deviation. Boundary conditions are nonlocal y′ (−1) + ay′ (1) = 0, y (−1) − y (1) = 0.

However, different languages show distinct preferences for one of these interpretations (Lovric, 2003): why this happens is unclear. Since prosodic phrasing can disambiguate syntactic structure (Kraljic, Brennan, 2005), the Implicit Prosody Hypothesis posits that even during silent reading a disambiguating prosodic structure is projected on the visual stimulus and this explains the different resolution preferences, based on the diversity of prosodic systems across languages (Fodor, 2002a).

After a theoretical introduction to the User Engagement and Gaming Literacy constructs, we present two validated Italian translations of scales representing them. Lastly, we test these two gaming variables in a pilot study on the postvocalic realizations of /k t/ in the Florentine variety. Results show that both variables positively condition the production of non-continuants (i.e., emphasized words) but through different underlying mechanisms.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",78,2021

We divided the spectrum of the voice into four categories, extrapolating refined biological information. In particular we analysed the adduction of the vocal cords, the use of the oral cavity, the mucosal wave and the physiological aspects of the apparatus. This new idea of voiceprint has proved to be an unexpectedly effective rehabilitation tool.

All rights reserved.The study comprehensively presents the main ef fects of digitisation. Due to its complexity, digitisation affects the employment and labour markets in different ways. It partially changes working conditions, brings to life new forms of employment and, as a result of the development of technology, professions disappear. Thus, all this necessarily poses different challenges to the legislation. The forms of work in the gig economy – which was brought to life by the online space – cannot be classified as a traditional legal framework. Teleworking has been absolutely valorised by the coronavirus pandemic. Looking to the near future, after the end of the pandemic, teleworking is expected to play a much more significant role in the labour market. The study presents the marked forms of digitisation that have emerged in employment and summarises its supranational legal issues. It also presents the digitisation characteristics of Hungary, Italy and Spain. It examines how legislation and the judiciary have provided answers to the issues of digitisation. Consequently, the study analyses three main trends: the impact of digitalisation in general, telework, and the gig economy, with special regard to the categorisation of workers (employees, self-employed and possible third categories in between). The study argues that the concept of ‘employment relationship’ has to be interpreted in a much broader way; general guarantees must be valid for all forms of work performed by people in economic dependence and in a state of economic weakness.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",null,2021

Therefore, we can take advantage of three anniversaries – the eightieth anniversary of the “Ventotene Manifesto” (1941), the thirtieth anniversary of the death of Ursula Hirschmann (1913-1991), the twentieth anniversary of the adoption of the Nice/Strasbourg Charter of Fundamental Rights of EU (2000) – to propose a counter-history of the last twenty years of the continental integration process.

All rights reserved.The use of social media has allowed anyone to spread their thoughts with a speed and a capillarity that eclipse those of the large traditional press companies. Within these “virtual squares” also operate the so-called “social bot”, programs that, once provided with the login credentials of an account, are capable of managing it independently, but giving the impression of being a real person. Their rapidity and precision of reaction on social networks make these “digital tools” dangerously useful for the dissemination of insinuations, slanders and offenses with a breadth and speed that can irreparably destroy the reputation of anyone who is targeted by their administrators. The current legal system for the protection of victims of defamation, despite the recent jurisprudential rulings on the online dissemination of falsehoods and the extension of the use of remedies, such as preventive seizure to social networks, still risks being ineffective when confronting a well-concerted use of these “socialbot”. Not even the countermeasures introduced by the owners of social media have been able to effectively stem this phenomenon. Thus, it is necessary to rethink the protection of reputation extending it to the prevention of improper use of IT tools that are now within everyone’s reach. Therefore, various hypotheses are proposed in this article for solving the problem, including the extension to the owners of social media of the obligation of ""customer due diligence"" already existing for financial operators or the establishment of an obligation for social media owners to set up an internal reporting system with also a mark visible to the other users of the content deemed defamatory.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",115,2021

All rights reserved.The Algerian steppe rangelands are undergoing a degradation of their natural resources, leading to a drastic fall in forage productivity. This fodder production is marked by a great inter-seasonal and inter-annual variability, which makes difficult their management and the calculation of the animal load/hectare during the season. The objective of our study is to develop a direct evaluation technique, simple and quick to implement, to determine the animal load of a steppe rangeland, dominated by the forage plant Artemisia herba alba. For this, we made the hypothesis that there is a fairly strong correlation between the pastoral value (PV) (expressed as a note or score) and the pastoral productivity (PP). Knowing that PP is expressed in FMU/ha/season and calculated from the yield and nutritional value of the plant, we can indirectly deduce an animal load. The disadvantage is that it is an expensive (chemical composition), cumbersome and time-consuming method. These obstacles do not suit the users, especially the time factor closely linked to the stage of exploitation of the plant which evolves rapidly in these areas. On the other hand, the (PV) is a direct evaluation technique less expensive, faster, the result is expressed as a note or a score corresponding to an animal load. The correspondence is established thanks to a set of information such as the global coverage, the specific contribution and the specific index (calculated on the basis of a set of information such as bromatological, appreciation of the stockbreeders, bibliographic...). For our study, the specific index will no longer be empirical and its calculation will be based on the clump volumes of the plant studied. The study proposes a simple management tool to define an opportune period of exploitation of steppe rangelands thanks to the nutritional value of the plant The hypothesis that (PV) and (PP) are strongly correlated was verified (r=0.87), also the hypothesis that dry matter and clump volume are fairly correlated was verified (r=0.74). The results show a pastoral productivity (PP) in the order of 380.38±12.13 FU/ha and a pastoral value (PV) equal to 11.78±0.33, which corresponds to a possible load per hectare of the studied range oscillating between 3.13±0.18 and 3.66±0.12 sheep units in spring.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",14,2021

Carbon storage in the soil (0-75 cm) was evaluated by measuring the evolution of soil carbon stocks between 2015 and 2019. Total carbon stocks over the entire profile (0- 75cm) varied according to the geoclimatic zone (Gâtine, Bressuirais, Thouarsais), the temporary or permanent status of the meadows, and the clay and gravel content of the soils. On average over the network, carbon storage was evaluated at 1.36 ± 0.88 t C / ha / year (0-75cm). This positive average value, however, masked a strong heterogeneity of situations, with stocking plots (26/35) and destocking plots (9/35). The rate of carbon storage over the entire soil profile was affected by the clay content of the soils and the initial value of the soil carbon stock at the earliest date of observation. On average over the grassland network, the carbon stock increased significantly between the two sampling dates in the 25-50 cm horizon but not in the surface horizon (0-25 cm), showing the important role that can have the horizons deeper than the 0-30 cm horizon, which is usually considered in carbon storage studies.

Knowledge of COVID-19 was graded as good with a minimum score of 75% while perception was graded as good with a score greater than the mean scores. Preventive practices were categorized as good with minimum scores of 75%. Associations between knowledge, practice, and categorical variables were assessed using the chi-square test with the level of significance set at p < 0.05 Results: The mean age of respondents was 42.30 ± 8.73 years.

Case presentation: A case of 40-year-old para 5+0 woman with anterior vaginal wall leiomyoma is reported. The presentation mimics that of uterovaginal prolapse and hence presents a diagnostic challenge. The unusual appearance of the protrusion, failure to reduce at any time even while lying down, and complete absence of urinary symptoms raised the suspicion of a rare case. The diagnosis was made through examination under anesthesia, cystoscopy, and biopsy. Histological examination of the biopsy specimen confirmed vaginal wall leiomyoma. The patient had complete excision of the mass without any complications. Discussion and Conclusion: Vaginal wall leiomyoma is a rare benign vaginal lesion that can easily be misdiagnosed. Diagnosis involves critical clinical evaluation, especially during pelvic examinations. Any vaginal protrusion should be approached with a high index of suspicion, especially in patients of reproductive age.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",12,2021

Methods: This is a descriptive cross-sectional survey of 398 non-medical staff of Babcock University who were selected using the multi-stage sampling technique. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 21) to compute frequency distributions, means, and standard deviations. Nutritional knowledge, dietary practices, and barriers to work productivity were assessed. Inferential statistical analysis was conducted using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Results: The mean age among respondents was 38.68±11.04, with the majority being female 54.6%. of the respondents (61.1%) of Yoruba origin, about three percentiles (66%) were members of staff while (34%) were faculty members. The computed level of knowledge and dietary-based practices scores were (2.57±0.61) and (3.64±1.44) respectively, indicating poor knowledge and dietary practices, while the barriers that influence work productivity among workers (11.34±5.286) were high at 87.2%. No significant association was found between nutritional knowledge and dietary practices of staff and faculty (p=.154), but a significant association was found between dietary practices and work productivi ty of staff and faculty (p=.019) Conclusion: Health education and promotion of good nutrition should be incorporated in the workplace, interventions that will improve work productivity among workers are also encouraged.

METHODS The demands of 78 college ice hockey players were asked through open questionnaires. Collected results underwent integrated analysis to develop the desired program through the participants who were also observers of the team. The objectives of the program were established, and an appropriate program was developed based on the analyzed data, expert opinion, and precedent research. The developed program was applied to 26 players of a college ice hockey team to verify its effects. Tasks included writing experience reports and in-depth interviews. The Happiness Measures 1, Strength Knowledge, and Team Interaction Questionnaires were also administered. Collected qualitative data were categorized to follow inductive analysis procedures, while paired t-tests were performed for quantitative data using SPSS 25.0. RESULTS To improve the application of the program in real situations and maintain credibility and validity, the program was developed based on analyses of individual and team demands, methods of the participant as an observer, expert opinion, and other considerations. Statistically meaningful differences in positive psychological mind, happiness, recognition and utilization of strengths, team interactions, team cohesion, and so on were found using paired t-tests comparing data before and after the developed positive psychological intervention program.

The analysis of thirteen speeches given by prominent Southern Cameroonian nationalists was guided by Wodak et al.’s Discourse-Historical Approach and led to the identification of three semantic macrostruc-tures.

All rights reserved.In the landmark case Bronston v. US, the Supreme Court put forward a reading of the perjury statute according to which one could only be tried for perjury on the basis of what one had stated, not what was implicated. This decision has given rise to a number of theoretical and practical problems, best detailed in Tiersma (1990) and Douglis (2018). This article argues that a formal investigation of discourse structure, of the type developed in Asher and Las-carides (2003), coupled with an understanding of the role of ellipsis in discourse, allows us to develop a framework that captures those instances of perjury that seem to fall through the cracks of the literal truth condition without introducing speaker’s intent on the solution. The crucial idea that the analysis hinges on is the notion that an indirect answer to a question is a two-node discourse with an elliptical polarity answer. Approaches based on Grice’s implica-tures or speaker’s communicative intent are discussed and shown to be inadequate.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': 'December 2021', 'day': '31'}",19,2021

All rights reserved.Interpreters in lawful interception of communications are an almost invisible group of language professionals. They participate in secret surveillance measures and enable law enforce-ment authorities to intercept conversations held in a foreign language. This group of translational agents who perform a hybrid activity between interpreting and translation within an institutional legal context has received scant attention from either translation and interpreting or legal studies. If the topic is addressed at all, it is most often examined within the context of police interpreting, even though intercept interpreters do not participate in the kind of tri-adic communication situation typical of face-to-face interpreting. Moreover, the sensitive context makes it difficult to collect data on the topic. In this article, we analyse nine judgments rendered by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court (FSC) from 2002 to 2019 concerning lawful interception with interpreters. Higher courts not only dispense justice but also contribute to the continued development of the law. Their judgments are also a rich source of knowledge, providing rare information about an understudied research area. These judgments are crucial because, as we will argue, it is the legal order and its implementation through jurisprudence that shape the degree of (in-)visibility of intercept interpreters. In addition, these judgments provide valuable information about the working processes and professional context of intercept interpreters. Our qualitative content analysis reveals that the FSC explicitly demands the visibility of intercept interpreters and their activity in some cases while implicitly accepting or deliberately generating their invisibility in others.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': 'December 2021', 'day': '31'}",44,2021

All rights reserved.This paper explores the effect of the #MeToo movement on sexual assault discourse and social norms in legal discourse in the United States through a case study of Commonwealth v. William Henry Cosby Jr., a trial that occurred both before and after the emergence of the movement. Specifically, to what extent did #MeToo affect sexual assault culture and discus-sions around it in legal settings? Using Kukla’s (2014) theoretical framework of Discursive Injustice (DI) in order to analyze portions of Commonwealth v. Cosby, I observe the level of performative power the complainant in the trial, Andrea Constand, is able to express and the frequency with which her expression is limited by other actors, namely defense lawyers. I find that the largest changes in aggressiveness and frequency of DI between the 2017 and 2018 portions of the trial occur during juxtapositions between Constand and “victim” stereotypes of sexual assault. This shift suggests a larger social change in community conventions regarding stereotypes and expectations of sexual assault survivors. This paper aug-ments the growing literatures on the impact of the #MeToo movement on sexual assault culture and DI as a theory of linguistic and social power.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': 'December 2021', 'day': '31'}",13,2021

While research has shown that language specific socio-cultural, rhetorical and lexico-grammatical factors impact levels of self-concealment vs. self-promotion, less attention has been paid to the ways in which translated texts are sensitive to these discoursal traditions. We address this gap by analyzing frequency, rhetorical use, and grammatical form of FPPs in a corpus of research article (RA) abstracts in biology written by Russian and international researchers in two peer-reviewed bilingual journals. Three subcorpora were analyzed: (i) L1 Russian abstracts; (ii) the same abstracts translated into English; (iii) abstracts by international biologists in English from the same journals. The FPP tokens were identified and their frequency, rhetorical use, and forms were compared. The results show significant differences between the corpora which supports previous findings on cross-cultural variation in authorial presence in research genres. The results also suggest that the translation not only transfers L1 linguistic code but also adds a stronger emphasis on author agency. Implications for translating RAs into English as an exercise in linguistic, cognitive, and pragmatic equivalence as well as for accommodating discourse conventions of English as a lingua franca of science are explored.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",71,2021

The findings suggest that the discursive and non-discursive challenges perceived were aggravated by the lack of critical-pragmatic approaches, the poor English writing skills developed for academic purposes, and the lack of support for editing their papers in English, particularly from thesis supervisors. This led them to experience feelings of anxiety, frustration and discomfort about writing in English.

Frequent hospital visits are needed on the part of the patient to achieve decreased prevalence, the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and viral suppression. Patient satisfaction is needed to achieve the aforementioned outcomes of care. This study, therefore, was conducted to assess clients’ satisfaction and perception of the quality of HIV/AIDs services and to elicit factors associated with dissatisfaction. Method: A cross-sectional survey was done using a systematic sampling method to select the study population. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, chi-square test, and logistic regression at a p-value set at < 0.05. Results: Most of the respondents (34.4%) were within the age range of 36-44years. The mean age was 42.1± 11.5years. The overall satisfaction was 85.6%. The majority of respondents (95.2%) affirmed that the quality of care received was good.

Many recommend that transcripts should be produced, or evaluated, by experts in acoustic-phonetic analysis. However, this does not necessarily solve all the problems.

In this study, we examine the manufacturing process of kemençe considering its relationship with natural sources. Data about the production and performance of kemençe are collected by fieldwork since 2018. In this context, the first author took kemençe courses from Ilyas Parlak, a well-known kemençe player, to understand the performance of the instrument in the region. He also held interviews with the luthiers to understand the usage of the biological and non-biological materials in the making process of this instrument. In this study, we propose the term sound ethnobiology to reveal how instruments are associated with nature in relation to their manufacture and performance. We have considered the term sound ethnobiology of musical instruments into five categories which are interrelated to each other. These categories are ‘bioecological sources of sound production’, ‘ecological knowledge of sound production’, ‘timbre arrangement of producing proper sound’, ‘traditional ecological knowledge of the sound of musical instruments’, and ‘ecological meanings of musical instruments’. We have put forward the manufacturing process and performances of the kemençe and its relationship to the nature in and around Trabzon by considering these five categories. Thus, we revealed that the kemençe making process is strongly tied to the interpretation of the natural sources in the region. This interpretation of the usage of the natural sources creates the traditional ecological knowledge of kemençe which is also strongly connected to its ecological meaning and the nature of the Eastern Black Sea region.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",52,2021

Using the theory of glocalization, the genre will be discussed as a means to understand current dynamics in the music industry. This research is a product of a discography survey and fieldwork consisting of extended interviews with DJs and musicians who were a part of the scene. What is labeled as disco music in Turkey, and what is referred to as 'Turkish disco' in the global music industry are, in fact, two different music cultures. The term's local usage refers to specific Turkish recordings from the late 1970s, in which various forms of Turkish art and folk music were reinterpreted, usually with Moog synthesizers. On the other hand, more recent connotations of Turkish disco owe much to DJs, and the digging, editing, and remixing culture of the 2010s. Coming hand in hand with the term Turkish psychedelic, many of these recent edits and remixes by DJs and producers were selected from the LPs and singles of the 1970s, which drew inspiration from pop, soul, folk, jazz, psychedelic rock, funk, and Anatolian pop. Thus, Turkish disco in the past decade has become an umbrella term for contemporary edits and remixes of the Turkish popular music of the 1970s. The reinterpretation of the forms such as Oyun Havası and potpori within the subheading of disco will be analyzed to understand the cultural aesthetics of taste and the political background of musical fusion.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",53,2021

All rights reserved.System testing is a crucial part of likelihood ratio based forensic voice comparison, but the evaluation of system performance has thus far focused on global metrics, with little attention paid to the variation in individual performance and the factors behind such variation. Using long-term formant distributions as a case study, this study applies the notion of biometric menagerie to analyse performance on the individual level, and further explores the connection between performance and the underlying acoustic data. Zooplot analysis reveals distinct distributions of how individual speakers perform for each long-term formant. Acoustic analysis further reveals clear patterns in the formant data displayed by speakers with outlying performance. Together, the findings support the view that individual-level analysis can offer useful diagnostic insights into system performance that are unavailable in global-level assessment.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",30,2021

All rights reserved.Zinc borate (ZB) is a flame retardant and smoke supressant compound of boron. It is widely used to achieve flame resistant polymer composites. Poly(Vinyl Chloride) (PVC) is one of the commercially important polymers that is mostly used for cable insulating, windows, doors, pipes, floorings and toys etc.. On the other hand, PVC releases toxic gases during fire as decomposition products. Zinc borate addition is thought to be a solution for this problem. However, this solution leads a new problem. Zinc borate effects the mechanical properties of the PVC. In the present study, to optimize the contribution of zinc borate, with different formulations (2ZnO·3B2 O3·3.5H2 O and 4ZnO·B2 O3·H2 O), with different additive ratios (1% and 5% by weight) and different particle sizes (nano-sized and micro-sized) were added to the PVC structure and the mechanical and thermomechanical properties of each composite were investigated. Mechanical properties of composites were determined by tensile test, impact test, hardness test while thermomechanical behaviours were detected with dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). In the perspective of mechanical strength of PVC-ZB composite, additive ratio of ZB was more effective than particle size and chemical formulation of ZB. The additive ratio more than 5% by weight can negatively affect the mechanical strength and quality of the PVC-ZB composite.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",39,2021

All rights reserved.The issue of labour exploitation has been given media coverage at local and international level. It is one form of human trafficking which has been condemned by the international community. As a member of the International Labor Organization (ILO), this issue needs to be taken seriously. This study aims to examine the international labour standard and the Malaysian law relating to forced labor and trafficking in person by analysing the related legal framework using a doctrinal methodology and library based research as well as analysis of selected decided cases. Although Malaysia has local laws such as the Anti-Trafficking in Persons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act 2007 (ATIPSOM) [Act 670] which covers aspects of exploitation and coercion, as well as Employment Act 1955 [Act 265]and Workers' Minimum Standards of Housing and Amenities Act, 1990 [Act 446), there are allegations that there are lacuna in these laws which need to be improved in order to address the issue of labour exploitation or forced labor practices in Malaysia successfully. It may be concluded that since the terms of forced labor are not defined in any law in Malaysia it causes ambiguity and difficulties in the application and enforcement of law. Thus, it is very important to carefully understand the intended meaning of a term in the legislation to ensure the extent of labour exploitation or forced labor practice in the Malaysian context.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",32,2021

All rights reserved.For many Muslim patients, families and intensive care physicians, deciding on whether to withhold or withdraw life support remains challenging. This point of transition from active intervention to the palliation process requires a crucial decision-making process. The decision involves conveying information to families to be well prepared beforehand, especially during the process of withdrawing life-sustaining treatment. Once the final decision to withdraw life sustainment has been made, procedure on cessation of care, treatment withdrawal and nature of follow-up support will be informed to the family members. This is especially so considering that the relationship between Islamic ethico-legal guidance and clinical protocols on such matters remains scattered and difficult to interpret. In light of this gap, we conducted a short review to aggregate clinical protocols and rulings from Islamic fatwas on whether, and when, it is permitted to withdraw and/or withhold life-sustaining care. This article aims to explore relationship regarding decision in withholding and withdrawing life-sustaining treatment, based on guidelines by Malaysian intensive care unit protocol and the fatwa in Malaysia. The methodology chosen for this study is content analysis of the relevant published literatures. We found the decision for withholding and withdrawing life sustaining treatment in intensive care unit are correlated between the ICU protocol and fatwa in Malaysia. In addressing the withholding and withdrawal of life-sustaining measures, the Muslim health-care workers as well as families should take a more cohesive approach, as this is parallel to the fatwa in Islam.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",33,2021

Various initiatives are carried out by the authorities such as the Syariah High Court, the Syariah Judiciary Department of Malaysia (JKSM) and the Islamic Religious Council for each state in Malaysia to overcome this problem. This is because, this issue involves the welfare of Muslim children, that are affected by divorce as well as the rights of disputing parties, namely mother and father that need to be emphasized. Therefore, this literature review is to identify the issues that arise, the development and solutions provided for haḍānah issues. This study is qualitative by taking a descriptive content analysis approach by evaluating facts and arguments from various primary and secondary sources related to the study. To support the findings of the study, syariah court judge was also interviewed. The results of literature review shows that several issues are arising in the Syariah Court such as the existence of International Convention affecting Islamic Family Law, the limitation of sole custody practice, the absence of specific interpretations for the welfare of Muslim children, the issue of determining children`s religion in ḥaḍānah, the issue of ḥaḍānah is assumed biased towards women. This study also identifies positive developments in the resolution of ḥaḍānah cases in terms of its application, namely the interpretation of the welfare of the children in ḥaḍānah is clarified, the proposal of the concept of maṣlaḥah as a measure of children's welfare, granting joint custody to parents, sulh function in ḥaḍānah, proposed establishment of the Family Court in Malaysia and involvement of experts in related disciplines. However, in general, there are some of these suggestions that have not been implemented and are still at the evaluation stage. Therefore, this study suggests that these aspects need to be discovered and specific guidelines need to be formed and harmonized based on the principles of haḍānah welfare to achieve Maqāṣid Al-Sharī ̒ah which also is in accordance with the demands of the times and social changes in Malaysia.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",37,2021

All rights reserved.Real estate remains one of the most significant properties for personal use and investment purposes. Individual institutions and corporate bodies operate on real estate properties. In recent times, there have been several concerns among zakatable individuals and organizations on the shariah criteria for identifying zakatable real estate properties because of the difference between assets for personal use and commercial purposes. There is 'arūd tijārah (commodities for sale) such as real estate, land, car, and goods in real estate investment. On the other hand, 'arūd quniyyah, (durable properties) are intended for personal use such as a private house, private car, private vacation home. This study aims to conceptually analyze the concept of intention in Islam and its juristic interpretations to distinguish between zakatable and non-zakatable real estate properties. This study relies on the inductive approach in gathering and arranging data from classical and modern literature. It also uses the descriptive method in explaining the basic terms in the research. The study found that real estate owners' intent influences the asset's zakat status. First, 'arūd quniyyah (real estate) are durable assets, meant for personal use, are Zakat free, while the real 'arūd tijārah (estate commercial assets) are subject to Zakat. The commercial assets can also be for sale and rental. The study finally suggests that zakat calculations of zakatable real estate should be subjected to supervision and validation of competent contemporary Shariah scholars to ascertain juristic position on the distinctions between zakatable and non-zakatable assets.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",33,2021

Little is known about the nature of diplomatic relations between Malaysia and North Korea, especially when public perceptions dictate that both countries barely share any similarities. In appreciating the implications of the murder case from the perspective of international law, an analysis is carried out on the history of diplomatic relations between Putrajaya and Pyongyang. A further study is conducted on the factors which attract Malaysia and North Korea to forge and strengthen their diplomatic relations. Malaysia’s inclusive foreign policy is highlighted via her participation in the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) in 1970 which promotes peaceful engagement with all countries regardless of their political allegiance, including the Communist-led regime in North Korea. The task of preserving regional safety and bolstering economic prosperity are top on Putrajaya’s priority list. With the volume of bilateral trade between Malaysia and North Korea is steadily increasing and Pyongyang’s continuous provocations of her Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), peaceful engagements with the aim of repairing the damaged diplomatic relations is the best option for both countries. This study concludes that although the relationship between the two nations are severed, it is crucial for Malaysia to consider reviving and enhancing bilateral relations with North Korea, hence benefiting Putrajaya in outlining Malaysia’s future foreign policy.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",187,2021

Usually, the Muslim women enforces the claim for her maintenance while obtaining divorce. Divorce brings distress in her life and it also creates jeopardized situation in the society. In doing so, the controversy arises regarding the post-divorce maintenance beyond iddat period of Muslim women under Islamic Shariah. Though the judiciary of many countries are trying to reform on the post-divorce maintenance, but judicial activism of the country has not much advancement in this issue. Hence, the divorced Muslim women are not entitled post-divorce maintenance beyond iddat period in the country. In addition, often women are not getting access to family justice rather they suffered adversely for difficulties of legal procedure, male oriented society and non-implementation of Islamic values. Therefore, majority divorced woman faces many challenges of social justice and not being protected in the present legal system.

This qualitative study using the method of desk review of materials such as books, journals, and newspaper articles identifies the human rights protection framework for asylum seekers and refugees and the problematic implications and challenges for both refugees and the host country, Malaysia, due to the absence of a formal refugee protection framework at the national level. Despite gaps in and outdated nature of the 1951 Refugee Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, it calls for refugee legal protections to be based on a legal and governance framework rather than non-binding aspirations and ad hoc approaches. The latter has proved adverse to both the interests of the host state and refugee communities. The findings indicate that the impacts on denial and violation of the rights and protections of refugees across political, social, and economic terrains are accompanied by risks to Malaysia’s public security and interests. The study concludes with several early recommendations on the need to firstly recognise the legal status of refugees in Malaysia and the urgency to design an adequate protection and governance framework complemented with a system of shared responsibility to protect and manage refugees who have been in protracted limbo for an average of 20 years, if not more, without durable solutions to their plight.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",79,2021

All rights reserved.The present study has reported the production of the environmentally friendly Kombucha tea fungus (TF), as well as its investigation as a potential biosorbent to remove cationic methyl violet (MV) dye from the aqueous solutions. TF was characterized by using FT-IR, thermal analysis and zeta potential measurements. The biosorption of MV was significantly dependent on the pH of the solutions and the highest removal for MV was observed at pH=9.0 which was also proved with zeta potential measurement. Biosorption equilibrium was established in 10 min and a definition of the overall ratecontrolling step in the biosorption of MV onto TF was carried out. The biosorption data were in good agreement with the pseudo-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isotherm models. The maximum biosorption capacity of TF for MV was determined as 1180.09 mg g−1. In addition, an effective biosorption performance was observed even in the presence of high foreign ion concentrations. The results indicated that TF could be utilized as a highly efficient biosorbent for MV biosorption from aqueous solutions.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",43,2021

The fact that these harmful species cause oxidative damage to biological macromolecules is expressed as prooxidant activity. In this study, Cu(II)‒catalyzed prooxidant activities of pomegranate, apricot, peach, and pear juices and extracts of mint, white tea, and rosehip were measured by using gold nanoclusters synthesized via chicken egg white proteins. Fluorometric and spectrophotometric gold nanocluster biosensors and carbonyl assay were used. The fruit juices were used directly by diluting with pure water. Herbal plant samples were extracted in an ultrasonic water bath, filtered through microfilters, and stored in the refrigerator. Total prooxidant activities of fruit juices and herbal plants were calculated in terms of mM epicatechin equivalent, and the results obtained by applying all methods were compared with each other.

All rights reserved.The classification methods consider the probability of predicting the majority class to be high when the number of class observations is different. To address this problem, there are some methods such as resampling methods in the literature. Undersampling, one of the resampling methods, creates balance by removing data from the majority class. This study aims to compare different optimization methods to determine the most suitable observations to be taken from the majority class while undersampling. Firstly, a simple simulation study was conducted and graphs were used to analyze the discrepancy between the resampled datasets. Then, different classifier models were constructed for different imbalanced data sets. In these models, random undersampling, undersampling with genetic algorithm, undersampling with differential evolution algorithm, undersampling with an artificial bee colony, and under-sampling with particle herd optimization were compared. The results were given rank numbers differing depending on the classifiers and data sets and a general mean rank was obtained. As a result, when undersampling, artificial bee colony was seen to perform better than other methods of optimization.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",31,2021

All rights reserved.This paper deals with the evaluation of lipophilicity expressed by logPow parameter of ten barbiturate derivatives generally used as sedative-hypnotics based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. All geometry optimizations and frequency calculations have been carried out by using DFT/B3LYP/ 6-311++G (d,p) basis set in gas phase and also in water and n-octanol phases. Gibbs free energies of solvation for studied barbiturates were calculated to predict logPow. The correlation between the calculated logPow values and available data in literature has been examined. Root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), mean absolute deviation (MAD) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) statistics were utilized in measuring predictive accuracy (forecast performance) of DFT method used in this study. Accordingly, the reasonable results have been obtained in estimating the partition coefficient of the mentioned ten barbiturate derivatives by DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G (d,p) method. The lipophilicity tendency of the studied barbiturates was interpreted with the help of the calculated quantum chemical descriptors such as HOMO energy (EHOMO), LUMO energy (ELUMO), molecular volume (Vm), electrophilicity index (ω). ELUMO, Vm, and ω descriptors gave reasonable results rather than EHOMO. Also, the 3D molecular lipophilicity potential (MLP) maps that display the accumulative lipophilic contributions of each atom in studied barbiturates were visualized.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",52,2021

All rights reserved.Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease and pathologically characterized by the presence of neurofibrillary tangles (tau aggregation) and amyloid plaques (amyloid-beta (A!) aggregation). PSEN1 protein with 9 transmembrane helices acts as aspartyl protease and is one of the catalytic components of γ secretase complex, that cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP). Furthermore, PSEN1 protein plays a significant role in the process of APP and in the generation of amyloid beta (Aβ). In the present study, it was aimed to estimate the probable deleterious effects of missense SNPs in PSEN1 gene that is associated with AD on protein stability and structure by using bioinformatics tools. SIFT, PolyPhen-2, PROVEAN, PhD SNP, and PANTHER PSEP software were used to estimate the deleterious SNPs, whereas I Mutant 3.0 and MUpro web tools were used to determine the effects of amino acid substitution on protein stability. Additionally, the effects of wild type and mutant amino acids on protein threedimensional structure via modeling were predicted by Project HOPE webserver. The phylogenetic conservation of amino acid residues of PSEN1 protein was analyzed by ConSurf. In total, 386 missense SNPs were found in the human PSEN1 gene from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (NCBI dbSNP) database and 65 SNPs of which were determined to be deleterious or damaging. In the present study, 8 significant missense SNPsrs63749891 (R278T), rs63750301 (P264L), rs63750353 (N135D), rs63750524 (R278S), rs63750772 (E273A), rs63751229 (P267S), rs121917807 (G266S), and rs201617677 (R157S) were determined as high-risk pathogenic. Some differences between wild-type amino acids and mutant amino acids such as hydrophobicity, charge, size, and folding properties were determined according to the modeling findings. Our study demonstrates that high-risk pathogenic missense SNPs have the potential to alter the catalytic activity of the γ secretase complex and subsequently the amount of Aβ40 and Aβ42. Therefore, these missense SNPs may contribute to AD pathogenesis studies.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",32,2021

I do so by presenting and analyzing text-objects from my own research on language ideologies and language shift in northern Italy at various stages of entextualization, highlighting the multiple choices that shape transcription and how such choices are in turn shaped by a number of factors often invisible in the final, or at least public, versions of these texts that circulate the most widely. Transcripts such as the ones I discuss endure as evidence, in published and other forms, even as intertextual gaps punctuate their interdiscursive reproduction across instantiations.

Deltamethrin (DLT) is one of the pesticides used extensively in the Lake Van basin. In this study, it was aimed to determine the effects of DLT on the primary gill cell culture. Different concentrations of DLT (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 μM) were added to primary gill cell culture and the total antioxidant and oxidant levels, malondialdehyde (MDA), and 8- hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) levels were determined at the end of 24 and 48 h of administration. While the highest concentration of applied DLT (10 μM) caused a significant increase in the total oxidant level at 48 h, a decrease in the total antioxidant level was detected at 24 and 48 h (P < 0.05). The increase in MDA level, which is the product of lipid peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids, with DLT concentrations of 1–10 μM at the end of 24 and 48 h was found to be significant (P < 0.05). As a result, it can be said that DLT caused oxidative stress in the primary gill cell culture of Lake Van fish exposed to concentrations of 1 and 10 μM, but no genotoxic effect was observed.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",34,2021

In the study, the area used vertically by the fish in the tank, the mobility rate of fish in the tank, the rate of tendency of fish in eating as soon as they were fed, whether the fish test the feed, the interspecies feed competition, the time they start to take the first feed, the duration of the feed consumption of the fish and the feed area of the fish have been considered as behavioral evaluation criteria. The trout were monitored with a camera to determine their behavior. Considering all behavioral criteria, the best polyculture rate was determined as R 66%- B 34%. Brown trout were found to be more mobile and exhibit more relaxed behavior compared to other groups in polyculture. In addition, interspecies feed competition was mostly encountered in this group. As a result, in this study, in which two different trout species were monocultured and treated at different polyculture ratios, the main factor causing behavioral change in fish was found to be the different stocking rates of fish to each other in the same tank. Different rates applied in polyculture caused unpredictable changes in behavior in both species. The ratio of fish used in polyculture was found to be a considerable factor affecting the final product and their behavior for aquaculture.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2021

All rights reserved.Various synthesis methods are being developed in order to increase the number of scientific fields where nanoparticles can be used. Recently, the biosynthesis methods have eliminated the limitations of the traditional synthesis methods such as physical and chemical ones. They have been also developed as an alternative synthesis method. With green synthesis called herbal nanofactories, primary and secondary metabolites in plants enable the reduction and capping of nanoparticles. The functional groups of alkaloids, phenolics, terpenoids, ketones, polysaccharides, proteins, vitamins, and amino acids in plants react with silver metals in ionic form and reduce “+” valued metals to “0” valued nanostructures. At the same time, functional groups of secondary metabolites form bonds with “0” valued silver nanometals and cover the surface of silver nanometals; thus, stabilization is achieved. Synthesis by biological methods provides high efficiency and rapid synthesis and the production cost of silver nanoparticle decreases. Moreover, biosynthesis is an environment-friendly technique as it takes place inside a living being. With the latest technology, silver nanoparticles stand out in the fields of biosensor and photoimaging. In this review, in which areas silver nanoparticles are used and their biosynthesis, stabilization, characterization, antibacterial mechanism, and use as a biosensor will be discussed.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2021', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2021'}, 'day': '31'}",64,2021

The analysis results produce the findings by making new factors, namely tasamuh, gratitude, worship, and aqidah. Research implications/limitation – This spiritual attitude assessment can be used in all Madrasah Aliyah in Indonesia. However, due to the limitations of researchers in distributing questionnaires, this research was only conducted in Sintang Regency. Originality/value – Further research is expected to construct an assessment of the spiritual attitudes of students in terms of more specific aspects of learning and daily life.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",25,2022

Published by Islamic Education Department, State Islamic University Sunan Kalijaga Yogyakarta, ID.Purpose–Understanding of religious extremism has begun to enter the world of campuses in Indonesia today. Of course, this has an impact on intolerance behavior. Recent studies show that religious intellectual humility (IH) can shape a person's tolerant behavior. But so far, this topic has been minimally replicated in the learning process in Indonesia. Therefore, this research seeks to prove and explain the influence of religious IH in the learning process in shaping students' tolerant behavior. Design/methods/approach–This study is an ex-post facto research. The subjects were lecturers (29 people) and students (41 people) at Islamic Education Department (IED) from one of the Islamic universities in Maluku. Data collection techniques use the IHS scale, RHS, and tolerance behavior scale. Data analysis used a simple linear regression technique. Findings–The results of the study show that there is an influence of religious IH in the learning process to shape student tolerance behavior by p = 0,000 (p<0,05). The contribution of religious IH forms tolerance behavior of 76.2%. This means that apart from religious IH there are around 23.8% of other variables that also shape tolerant behavior such as empathy, self-disclosure, and giving support for the rights of others. Research implications/limitations–The limitation of this research is that the subject comes from a limited number of lecturers and students in Maluku. In addition, this study also did not use an experimental design. It is suggested that the next study needs to involve a large number of samples (educators and students), it is also expected that it needs to be replicated in the form of an experimental design. Originality/value–This study recommends educators (lecturers) continue to practice religious IH in the learning process, especially for their students (prospective IED teachers) so that later they can practice it in the IED learning process in the future.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",32,2022

All rights reserved.Intonation, one of the most mentioned subjects in instrument performance, directly affects the performance quality and influence. It is clear that such equipment has a direct effect on the performance as choosing an instrument that is not tuned precisely and an unideal mouthpiece, reed, bow, pick, etc. when examined physically. Variables such as psychological state, fatigue, illness or seasonal change, rather than physical dimensions, play an important role in the performance as well. Due to the structure of Turkish music with the meşk tradition, it is almost impossible to standardize the performance due to the differences in instrument making and pitch understanding in line with the demands. The clarinet, which was primarily used in the Western music performance, has become used in the Turkish music performance in time as well. In addition to the stable structure of Western music, the notes in the mucennep range began to be performed, but serious intonation problems have emerged. In addition to the intonation problems caused by the distances between the cork, chamois, mouthpiece, joints or bell in the clarinet's own physical structure, the sub-problems of the research include the intonation problem in the use of ornamentation and blowing techniques such as grace note, vibrato, glissando, trill, embouchure. Various other issues such as the use of tone holes, posture, holding, mouth, performance style, tongue and lip movements also affect the intonation in the clarinet performance of Turkish music. In this direction, it is aimed at addressing the factors that can cause intonation problems in Turkish music clarinet performance, providing a unification of chords for collective performance, and offering solutions to problems caused by intonation. Therefore, this research is important in terms of contributing to Turkish music clarinet performers, educators, students and the field of instrument manufacturing in terms of revealing the factors that cause intonation in the Turkish music clarinet performance and eliminating the intonation mistakes made in the performances completely or to the maximum level in line with their solutions. Survey method, one of the qualitative research methods, was used in this research. The universe of this research consists of the factors that affect the intonation in Turkish music clarinet performance. The universe will be studied. Therefore, the sample was not determined. In line with all the findings obtained, it can be said that the Turkish music clarinet performer should have a good musical aptitude, be a good listener, and work on blowing the long notes, blowing and ornament techniques in their daily practices, and studies to eliminate the intonation problems, especially for performing the notes in the mucennep range. Although electronic solutions may come to the fore in terms of contributing to the solution of the intonation problem, it was concluded that the main solution is largely the performer’s own.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",9,2022

It is so that parenting is created oriented towards the Qur'an and does not deviate from the ""standard rules"" of parenting based on the Qur'an. Hence, it is expected that there will be products for raising children who are illahiyah pious and socially pious. Design/methods/approach–This qualitative research with a content analysis approach explored and discussed the contents of written or printed information in the mass media more deeply. In this case, the researcher searched for articles closely related to parenting issues and about Luqman al-Hakim through Google Scholar. Findings– This study highlights several of Luqman's parenting characteristics that made him intelligent in raising children, i.e., being firm in matters of faith in QS Luqman verses 13 and 17, gentle in speaking in QS Luqman verses 13, 16, and 17, attached to the child (intimacy) in QS Luqman verses 13, 16, 17, 18, and 19, and constantly reminding children to do good in QS Luqman verses 13, 16, 17, 18, and 19. Research implications/limitations–Some of Luqman's parenting styles successfully explored based on QS Luqman, including parenting based on being valued, parenting based on understanding and enlightening, and parenting based on self-control. Originality/value–Research with the theme of positive parenting originating from the verses of the Qur'an about Luqman al-Hakim has not been studied much. Generally, studies only revolve around parenting, ways of educating, and Luqman Hakim's parenting concept. Nevertheless, studies related to positive parenting have not been found. Therefore, research is pure, rich in novelty, and has a positive scientific contribution.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",29,2022

All rights reserved.Backchannels (BCs) positively contribute to fluency in social interactions. However, their realisation is language-specific, which can cause miscommunication in intercultural contexts. Nevertheless, backchanneling is not formally taught in most classroom settings. To find out whether L2 learners still manage to acquire a target-like BC behaviour, we carried out an exploratory study on Italian learners of L2 German. We recorded Map Task dialogues performed by 6 dyads speaking L1 Italian and L2 German at different proficiency levels and 5 dyads speaking L1 German. We extracted BCs, defined as acknowledgment tokens, and other very short utterances (VSUs) with the same lexical realisation as BCs, but different functions. We analysed their frequency, length and lexical type according to their function. Preliminary results suggest that dyad-specific patterns play a larger role than L2 proficiency when predicting BC frequency and length. As for lexical choice of BC types, L2 learners prefer items shared with their L1 Italian. Specifically German types are only used by advanced learners, indicating a role of proficiency in this aspect of BC production.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",64,2022

From very early in life infants are sensitive to lexical stress contrasts, but, due to very limited vocal capabilities, the production of stress contrasts only starts in the second year of age. We address the question of whether, when and how a child learns to differentiate lexical (stress) from post-lexical prominence (accent) by acoustically examining the spontaneous productions of one child from North-East Italy recorded every 3 months from 18 to 36 months of age. Our analysis is cast in the framework of the Autosegmental Metrical Theory of Intonation. Results show that during the child’s prosodic development the duration of IP nuclear vowels increases linearly, the duration of unstressed vowels decreases linearly and the duration of stressed, prenuclear and ip nuclear vowels is progressively but non-linearly adjusted, consistent with the adult prosodic hierarchy.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",62,2022

All rights reserved.We carried out an exploratory study of narrative complexity, focussing on coarse phonetic measures such as the duration and number of interpausal units. Our corpus features picture based narratives produced by twenty German speakers from Switzerland. The task was designed to elicit simple and complex narratives, depending on the order of appearance of the events and the number of characters in the pictures. Our results show that complex stories have longer overall duration and higher number of interpausal units. A closer look reveals that most of the additional interpausal units in complex stories are short in duration and contain few syllables. Despite inter-speaker variation, this trend is also confirmed at the individual level. In our interpretation, even coarse quantitative phonetic metrics suggest that narrative complexity results not only into more material (i.e. duration), but also into less cohesion (i.e. fragmentation).","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2022

Synthesis of high-temperature ceramic powders was examined through milling durations, reduction temperatures, and excess magnesium addition. Thermochemical analysis of probable reaction products was conducted by the Factsage software. According to the results, the thermochemical predictions and resultant powder phases showed good coherency. High-energy milling has a significant effect on the formation of the zirconium boride phase after annealing. However, extended milling time and higher annealing temperature had no significant effect on composition of the constituted composite powders according to the X-ray diffraction results. An annealing temperature of 600ºC was enough to obtain ZrB2-based ceramic composite powders. In the final powder phases, the excess magnesium addition to the stoichiometric displays an important feature.

We included 75 cases and 304 controls. The incidence of no-reflow was 19.8%. There was a higher frequency of no-reflow in patients with primary PCI compared to the pharmacoinvasive strategy, in patients with one-vessel disease and in those with TIMI 0 before PCI. In-hospital mortality and heart failure were higher in patients with no-reflow (21.3% vs. 2.9% and 45.3% vs. 16.5, respectively; p<0.001). After multivariate analysis, the ischemic time > 12 hours, Killip Kimball (KK) > I, TIMI 0 before PCI, and one-vessel disease were the factors significantly associated with no-reflow after PCI. Conclusions. The ischemic time greater than 12 hours, the highest KK score, the presence of an occluded culprit artery (TIMI 0) before PCI and an one-vessel disease, were factors independently associated with no-reflow in patients with STEMI in Peru.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",36,2022

As regards FPs, we looked at their segmental composition and the surrounding context; for PRLs, we considered the lexical category of the word and the position within the word in which they occur. Beyond individual variability, both Italian and Spanish speakers use more PRLs than FPs, with no interlinguistic duration differences. Furthermore, vocalic final-word PRLs are cross-linguistically preferred. However, Italian speakers present a general higher rate of disfluencies. Finally, FPs show a different segmental composition – related to the language-specific phonetic/phonological inventory –, and seem to be involved in different sub-functions.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",60,2022

This work aimed to elucidate the effect of vortex generators on the dynamic and thermal behavior of the micro-fluidic flow. The results obtained show that the increase in the Reynolds number leads to an improvement in the quality of heat transfer in both cases of the study. Rectangular micro-channel with LVG can improve heat transfer compared to smooth rectangular micro-channel while consuming more pressure drop. In the range of Reynolds numbers between 200 and 1200, a 2-21% increase in the mean Nusselt number was observed for micro-channels with LVG compared to smooth micro-channels. This occurs through better mixing of the fluid, reduction in the thickness of the thermal boundary layer, and increased heat transfer area. In addition, the friction factor has been increased by more than 50% compared to smooth micro-channels, due to the local resistance of LVGs and the presence of secondary flows.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",28,2022

Twenty (20) male Wistar rats weighing 160-180g were divided into four (4) groups: Control which received 1ml of normal saline, SB-treated; received 200 mg/kg b.w, SB + Low Dose VCO-treated (SB + 5% VCO mixed with 95g of rat chow), and SB + High Dose VCO-treated (SB+ 15% VCO mixed with 85g of rat chow). The brain was processed for NRF-2, NF-kB, and acetylcholine esterase (AchE) gene expression levels. Also, the blood sample was processed for assessment of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and IL1B levels. One-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc tests were used to analyze data. SB-treated rats with no intervention showed anxiety-like behavior and impaired memory as depicted by a significant (p<0.0001) increase in anxiety index, increase in brain NF-KB, increase in serum IL1B and increase in AchE gene expression level, reduction in the recognition ratio, decreased spontaneous alternation performance, decreased CAT and SOD levels and decreased NRF-2 expression level when compared to other groups (especially control and SB + 5% VCO). VCO supplemented diet (both 5% and 15%) significantly (p<0.0001) increased the CAT and SOD levels, increased the NRF-2 gene expression level, and significantly (p <0.0001) decreased the IL1-B level. Moreover, 5% VCO significantly (p<0.0001) decreased the anxiety index, decreased AchE and NFkB gene expression levels, increased spontaneous alternation performance, and increased recognition ratio compared to 15% VCO. VCO shows a neuroprotective effect in attenuating cognitive impairment and anxiety-like behavior in SB-induced model by modulating oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways, and also enhancing cholinergic neurotransmission.

For the training of pharmacologists, this is also true. A component of structure is academic staff strength. We wanted to know the total academic staff strength of programs and departments in American universities that run training programs in pharmacology at post graduate level in order to inform development in Nigerian and other African academia. Through departmental and program webpages, we mined data on academic staff of departments running graduate programs leading to PhD Pharmacology in the USA. All the data were mined within 96 hours of starting the investigation in 2016 and again in 2021 and were studied using descriptive statistics. There were a total of 25 such programs listed by the American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics (ASPET) website. From the descriptive statistics, the programs were not identical and varied in their staff compositions by numbers. A total of 1,993 academic staff members in 2016 and 2,042 academic staff members in 2021 were serving the 25 graduate pharmacology programs collectively. Notably more than 25% and less than 50% of the three categories of professorial cadre were non-pharmacology PhD holders.

All rights reserved.In the present study, the effects of different boron salts on the micropropagation of Liquidambar orientalis Mill., a relict-endemic plant species, were investigated and genetic stability of micro-shoots was determined by ISSR marker technique. Especially in species with low salinity and drought tolerance, salt stress may cause physiological and molecular changes such as plant growth and development, increase in secondary metabolite content in response to stress, and somaclonal variation. In this context, three different concentrations of boric acid, sodium perborate, sodium metaborate and disodium octaborate salts were applied to meristems isolated from in vitro clonal propagated L. orientalis and the effects of these boron salts on meristem regeneration and development were evaluated. When compared to the control group samples in which no salt application was applied, the best regeneration percentage was determined as 1 mgL-1 disodium octaborate treatment with a value of 100%, while when the shoot forming capacity index was evaluated, 5 mgL-1 sodium perborate treatment with a value of 4.94 gave the best results. However, when compared with the mother plant, it was observed that all salt treatments caused somaclonal variation on genetic stability, and in the light of the analyzed data, the lowest 30% (5 mgL-1 disodium octaborate) and the highest 49% (1 mgL-1 boric acid) somaclonal variation were determined in all applications.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",55,2022

The yield gap was estimated by the frontier-based input distance function analysis. The results indicated that a large yield gap exists in the sample where an average dairy farm has a yield improvement potential of 55 percent. By closing the gap, an average dairy farm can increase yearly production of fat-corrected milk (FCM) by 120,036 kg and non-milking herd for meat by 25 heads. The evidence also shows that small farms (< 25 herd-size) are technically more efficient than those of medium (26 ≤ herd-size ≤ 50) and large farms (> 50 herd-size). The study finds clear evidence of an efficiency boost for keeping a higher share of non-milking to milking herd, a greater proportion of exotic cows to local breeds, and a higher farm-gate price of milk, which can all trigger efficiency gains. Policymakers hence have room to provide adequate intervention strategies that can help in enhancing efficiency.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",34,2022

All rights reserved.Objectives This study aimed to enable clinical researchers without expertise in natural language processing (NLP) to extract and analyze information about sexual and reproductive health (SRH), or other sensitive health topics, from large sets of clinical notes. Methods (1) We retrieved text from the electronic health record as individual notes. (2) We segmented notes into sentences using one of scispaCy's NLP toolkits. (3) We exported sentences to the labeling application Watchful and annotated subsets of these as relevant or irrelevant to various SRH categories by applying a combination of regular expressions and manual annotation. (4) The labeled sentences served as training data to create machine learning models for classifying text; specifically, we used spaCy's default text classification ensemble, comprising a bag-of-words model and a neural network with attention. (5) We applied each model to unlabeled sentences to identify additional references to SRH with novel relevant vocabulary. We used this information and repeated steps 3 to 5 iteratively until the models identified no new relevant sentences for each topic. Finally, we aggregated the labeled data for analysis. Results This methodology was applied to 3,663 Child Neurology notes for 971 female patients. Our search focused on six SRH categories. We validated the approach using two subject matter experts, who independently labeled a sample of 400 sentences. Cohen's kappa values were calculated for each category between the reviewers (menstruation: 1, sexual activity: 0.9499, contraception: 0.9887, folic acid: 1, teratogens: 0.8864, pregnancy: 0.9499). After removing the sentences on which reviewers did not agree, we compared the reviewers' labels to those produced via our methodology, again using Cohen's kappa (menstruation: 1, sexual activity: 1, contraception: 0.9885, folic acid: 1, teratogens: 0.9841, pregnancy: 0.9871). Conclusion Our methodology is reproducible, enables analysis of large amounts of text, and has produced results that are highly comparable to subject matter expert manual review.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",25,2022

Design/methods/approach – This research adopts a qualitative methodology with a narrative approach, focusing on thirteen Islamic religion teachers from both public and private high schools in Indonesia and Malaysia. Findings – This study divides the findings into three, namely teacher understanding, forms of application and constraints in experiential learning. Teachers' understanding of experiential learning based on this research is not evenly distributed. meaning that the teacher in theory does not know much but some have practiced it. the application of learning is carried out using online media. while the constraints faced came from internal and external factors. Research implications/limitations – This research recommends the use of experiential learning to enhance religious education. Teachers need to develop innovative learning strategies, while students should actively participate in the learning process and apply their experiences. The study also suggests that schools should incorporate experiential learning methods in their curriculum to enhance the effectiveness of religious education. These recommendations provide practical insights into developing religious education based on experiential learning. Originality/value – The study found similarities in the application of experiential learning in religious education between Indonesia and Malaysia, including the use of video media to increase students' interest in the material. However, both countries face similar obstacles, such as the need to increase teacher competence in innovative learning strategies, the presence of noise in new learning, and the need for standard syllabi.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",35,2022

Methods: Kidney pathological features of glomerular capillary dilatation and congestion, peritubular capillary dilatation and congestion, and intraglomerular neutrophil infiltration were screened and scored during kidney biopsy information interpretation. Eighty-four consecutive patients with these features and primary glomerulonephritis were analyzed, comparing to another 84 control patients without these features who were matched according to the pathological types of glomerulonephritis. Results: In the patients with pathological features of suspected intra-kidney venous thrombus, the levels of proteinuria (5.2 vs. 3.2 g/24 h, p = 0.005), serum creatinine (80.9 vs. 71.2 μmol/L, p < 0.001), platelet count (274.0 vs. 254.5 ×109/L, p = 0.020), D-dimer (0.2 vs. 0.2 mg/L, p = 0.002), and fibrin degradation products (1.9 vs. 1.0 mg/L, p = 0.003) were significantly higher than those in control patients. The levels of serum albumin (24.2 vs. 28.6 g/L, p = 0.003) and eGFR (92.1 vs. 103.9 mL/min/1.73 m2, p < 0.001) were significantly lower. The scores of these pathological features were positively correlated with the levels of D-dimer (r = 0.21, p = 0.05). During follow-up, 9 (10.7%) patients with pathological features of suspected intra-kidney venous thrombus developed venous thromboembolism, which was significantly more than that of control patients (0%, p = 0.006). Conclusions: Kidney pathological features could indicate intra-kidney venous thromboembolism, and their scores represent the possibility of thrombus. The notice of these features may provide clinical alerts for venous thromboembolism possibility.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",34,2022

All rights reserved.The study was conducted to investigate the effect of Polyalthia longifolia leaf extract (PLLE) in the diet of broiler chickens on their growth performance, nutrient digestibility and blood profile in the finisher phase. A total of 180 broiler chicks were used for the experiment. The birds were weighed on arrival and randomly assigned to 5 treatments and 3 replicates with 12 birds/replicate using a completely randomized design. The data were subjected to analysis of variance using SPSS version 21, and significant means were separated using Duncan’s Multiple Range Test in the same software. Vaccines were given to the birds in all treatments. The birds in treatment group 1 were not given any medication (negative control: without PLLE), T2 served as a positive control (given a conventional antibiotic), and T3, T4 and T5 received 15 g, 30 g and 45 g of Polyalthia longifolia per litre of water, respectively. The inclusion of PLLE had no significant (P > 0,05) effect on growth performance except for average total feed intake and daily feed intake. PLLE reduced the mortality rate of the broilers. Birds receiving 30 g PLLE per litre of water had similar final weight as treatment (T2 – positive control). This established the growth-promoting quality of PLLE in broiler production. Nutrient digestibility parameters were significantly different. Broilers receiving 45 g of PLLE per litre of water had similar nutrient digestibility to those receiving the conventional antibiotic. Birds in treatments 3-5 had significantly higher white blood cell counts, and lymphocyte, neutrophil and red blood cell counts were significantly higher in T3. Cholesterol levels increased with the concentration of PLLE, which indicates its hypercholesterolaemic quality. It was concluded that PLLE can be used without adversely affecting growth performance and thus provides an alternative to conventional antibiotics.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",33,2022

Hugona Kołłątaja w Krakowie', 'Krakow', 'Poland')]","© 2022, Polish Society of Animal Production. All rights reserved.The objective of this study was to assess the possibility of using two nonlinear models, i.e. the von Bertalanffy and Gompertz functions, for fitting growth curves of Popielno White and New Zealand White rabbits. The study was conducted using 37 Popielno White (21 male and 16 female) and 55 New Zealand White (28 male and 27 female) rabbits. The nonlinear regression procedure (NLIN) in SAS 9.4 software was used to model the rabbits’ growth curves from birth to 12 weeks of age. To see how rabbit growth might progress in subsequent weeks, we extrapolated the weights of the rabbits up to the age of 30 weeks. Six criteria were used to compare models: mean error, mean squared error, mean absolute error, quotient between the error sum of squares and observed sum of squares, corrected Akaike information criterion, and Bayesian information criterion. The shape of all curves was sigmoid, and both models fitted well to the data from birth to 12 weeks of age, i.e. during the interpolation process. A problem with the fit occurred later, during the extrapolation process, i.e. when the models were used to predict the animals’ course of growth in subsequent weeks. When body weight was extrapolated in later weeks of life, the fitting of the von Bertalanffy model was slightly worse, and asymptotic body weight was overestimated. To predict the further course of rabbit growth in practice, the Gompertz function would be a better choice. The Gompertz model could also be a helpful tool for breeders to describe the growth process of rabbits and to select a more economically profitable breed.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",19,2022

It became the primary permanent international forum for governments to discuss, negotiate and decide on matters specifically relevant to genetic resources for food and agriculture (GRFA). Over time, the mandate of the Commission expanded, and now it deals with all sectors of GRFA – plant, animal, forest, aquatic, and microbial and invertebrate genetic resources, covering the vast scope of biodiversity for food and agriculture. The Commission also considers a number of cross-cutting topics, including food security, nutrition and human health, mitigation of and adaptation to climate change, access to genetic resources and benefit sharing (ABS), and digital sequence information (DSI) on GRFA and biotechnologies for the characterization, sustainable use and conservation of GRFA. The work of the Commission on animal genetic resources (AnGR) initiated in 1997 resulted in preparation of the first-ever Report on the State of the World’s AnGR in 2007 and led to negotiation and adoption of the Global Plan of Action for AnGR (GPA), also in 2007. The endorsement of the GPA by the FAO Conference provided for commitments at the national level. The Commission monitors progress in the implementation of the GPA and the status and trends of AnGR on a biennial basis. Preparation of the Second Report on the State of the World’s AnGR in 2015 further strengthened the commitment to implement the 2007 GPA. The Commission plays an important role in supporting animal breeding and the livestock sector. It was instrumental in building the knowledge base on AnGR, creating a framework for action and supporting measures for its implementation. It has overseen important initiatives, including preparation of various technical guidelines and building global awareness of the importance of AnGR, as well as the specific characteristics of the AnGR sector. The work of the Commission is helping to ensure the conservation and sustainable utilization of GRFA, the genetic base for food production, thereby contributing to food security and agriculture development.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",44,2022

All rights reserved.Finishing cattle are fed diets high in concentrates to promote efficient deposition of both muscle and adipose tissue while decreasing cost of gain during finishing. The continued incidence of liver abscesses and increases in morbidity and mortality in the late finishing period have led to interest in increasing dietary roughage inclusion during late finishing. The objective of the current experiment was to evaluate the effects of increased roughage inclusion late in the finishing period on growth performance, carcass traits, blood metabolites, inflammation markers, and ruminal and faecal characteristics of feedlot steers. Crossbred beef steers (n = 60; initial body weight; BW = 289 ± 35,6 kg) were blocked by BW and assigned to experimental dietary treatments in a randomized complete block design during the final 58 d on feed. Experimental treatments included control (CON; 6% roughage dry matter; DM), intermediate (INT; 12% roughage DM), and high (HGH; 18% roughage DM) roughage diets (CON = 5 pens and INT and HGH = 4 pens; 4 steers per pen). All experimental diets contained dry-rolled corn, prairie hay, Sweet Bran (Cargill, Inc., Blair, NE), dry supplement, urea, and a corn-steep-and molasses-based liquid supplement. The inclusion rates of roughage and dry-rolled corn were adjusted for each experimental treatment, in which the increased roughage replaced dry-rolled corn. Overall dry matter intake (DMI) tended to increase linearly (P = 0,02) with increasing roughage inclusion. No differences in BW, overall average daily gain (ADG), or gain to feed ratio (G:F) were observed (P ≥ 0,72). Rib eye area increased linearly with increasing roughage inclusion (P = 0,02). Fat thickness, hot carcass weight (HCW), marbling, liver score, and kidney, pelvic, and heart fat (KPH) did not differ (P ≥ 0,29) among treatments. Steers consuming the HGH diet had a lower faecal pH at the end of the finishing period (P = 0,05) compared to CON and INT steers. Ruminal lactate was increased on d 14 for CON steers compared to other treatments (P < 0,001). No differences were observed for ruminal pH (P ≥ 0,11) among treatments at any collection. Results from the experiment suggest that increasing roughage late in the finishing period may not negatively impact growth performance or carcass characteristics but does alter feed intake and may alter fermentation and digestion.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",58,2022

All rights reserved.This work, based on the data obtained from the literature reported by (Varela et al., 2018), aims to use the artificial neural network approach to predict the heat and mass transfer in a dehumidifier system, using lithium chloride as a liquid desiccant. A neural network model was developed in MATLAB environment based on multilayer perceptron that included an input, hidden, and output layer. The network input parameters are air velocity, air temperature, air humidity ratio, liquid desiccant temperature, liquid flow rate, and liquid desiccant concentration. The network output includes two variables which are the heat transfer coefficient (Kh) and mass transfer coefficient (Km). The performance of the ANN model was evaluated using the statistical parameters between the prediction results and experimental values. The performance regression yields R2 and MSE values of 0.9344 and 9.0032, respectively, for the test data set of heat transfer coefficient (Kh). Moreover, for the mass transfer coefficient (Km), the regression parameter R2 and MSE values for the ANN tests were found to be 0.9657 and 2.0414, respectively. In addition, air velocity, air temperature, solution mass flow rate, and solution concentration are the most influential parameters on the heat and mass transfer between the air and liquid desiccant.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",15,2022

This study analyses, from an ethnomethodological (EM) participant perspective, video data of several screen recorded Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) matches being played by two teams that were geographically dispersed, to understand how teams choreograph their game play as part of larger sequences of situationally emergent tactics. We incorporate an understanding of expanded choreography developed within the field of dance to understand the interconnectedness of the interactional resources available to the participants to collectively, and situationally, choreograph their team play. The EM participant perspective provides a focus on what players, micro-interactionally, orient to and make relevant to each other by making each other accountable for own and others’ actions that are interconnected to the ‘basic elements’ of movement. The main findings are that the choreographing is done collectively and, largely, based on the information gathered in-and-through callouts that function as a choreographing device. However, the choreography is not based on verbal communication (alone), but on the interweaving and interdependence of each player’s movements and actions on-screen in-and-through interaction with the basic elements of movement.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",85,2022

This study focuses on the semantics of noun singulars and their plural inflectional variants in English. Our goal is to compare two models for the conceptualization of plurality. One model (FRACSS) proposes that all singular-plural pairs should be taken into account when predicting plural semantics from singular semantics. The other model (CCA) argues that conceptualization for plurality depends primarily on the semantic class of the base word. We compare the two models on the basis of how well the speech signal of plural tokens in a large corpus of spoken American English aligns with the semantic vectors predicted by the two models. Two measures are employed: the performance of a form-to-meaning mapping and the correlations between form distances and meaning distances. Results converge on a superior alignment for CCA. Our results suggest that usage-based approaches to pluralization in which a given word’s own semantic neighborhood is given priority outperform theories according to which pluralization is conceptualized as a process building on high-level abstraction. We see that what has often been conceived of as a highly abstract concept, [+plural], is better captured via a family of mid-level partial generalizations.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",52,2022

Using distributional semantics, we compare German word formation using particles with derivational word formation. We observed that derivational suffixes, but not particles, tend to make strong independent semantic contributions to their carrier words. In two-dimensional t-SNE maps, complex words show clustering by affix, but not by particle. Furthermore, the semantic vectors of suffixed words are predictable from their base words with higher accuracy than is possible for particle verbs. For particle verbs, but not affixed verbs, semantic similarity within the set of complex words correlated negatively with the number of types. Furthermore, only for particle verbs, a greater number of observed types predicted a reduced probability of observing unseen types. We propose that particle verbs primarily serve the onomasiological function of labeling, resulting in relatively idiosyncratic semantic vectors. By contrast, words sharing derivational affixes form distinct clusters in semantic space while maintaining strong and consistent semantic relations with their base words. This enables these words to serve not only as labels, but also allows them to be used with an anaphoric function in discourse.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",47,2022

We made use of word embeddings, high-dimensional vectors trained from large text corpora, and compared the observed paradigms of nouns that are defective in the genitive plural, as suggested by Zaliznjak (1977), with the observed paradigms for non-defective nouns. When the embeddings of about 20,000 inflected forms were projected onto a two-dimensional space, clusters of case and number within case were found, suggesting global semantic similarity for words with the same inflectional features. Moreover, defective lexemes were characterized by lower semantic transparency, in that inflected forms of the same lexeme are semantically less similar to each other, and their meanings are also more idiosyncratic. Furthermore, compared to non-defective lexemes, inflected forms from defective lexemes are further away from the idealized average case-number meanings, obtained by averaging over the vectors of all inflected forms of the same case-number combination. As a consequence, the semantics of defective forms are predicted less precisely by a simple model of conceptualization that assumes that the meaning of a given Russian inflected form is approximated well by the sum of pertinent embeddings of the lexeme, case, and number within case. We conclude that the relationship between defectiveness and semantics, at least the kind captured by word embeddings, is stronger than has been anticipated previously.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",37,2022

We compiled a dataset with around 2700 two-syllable compounds that shared position-specific constituents (henceforth pivots) and some 1100 suffixed words. For each pivot and suffix, we calculated measures of productivity as well as measures of semantic transparency. For compounds, productivity (P) was negatively correlated with the number of types (V) and with the semantic similarity between non-pivot constituents and their compounds. Conversely, the greater semantic similarity of the pivot with either the compound or the non-pivot constituent predicted higher degrees of productivity. Visualization with t-SNE revealed clustering of suffixed words’ embeddings, but no by-pivot clustering for compounds, except for a minority of pivots whose regions in semantic space did not contain intruding unrelated compounds. A subset of these pivots was found to realize a fixed shift in semantic space from the base word to the corresponding compound, a property that also emerged for several suffixes. For these pivots, no correlation between P and V was present. Thus, Mandarin compounds appear to realize, at one extreme, motivated but unsystematic concept formation (where other pivots could just as well have been used), and at the other extreme, systematic suffix-like semantics.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2022

We present a model for the conceptualization of Finnish inflected nouns, using pre-compiled fasttext embeddings (300-dimensional semantic vectors that approximate words’ meanings). Instead of deriving the semantic vector of an inflected word from another word in its paradigm, we propose that an inflected word is conceptualized by means of summation of latent vectors representing the meanings of its lexeme and its inflectional features. We tested this model on the 2,000 most frequent Finnish nouns and their inflected word forms from a corpus of Finnish (84 million tokens). Visualization of the semantic space of Finnish using t-SNE clarified that a ‘main effects’ additive model does not do justice to the semantics of inflection. In Finnish, how number is realized turns out to vary substantially with case. Further interactions emerged with the possessive suffixes and the clitics. By taking these interactions into account, the accuracy of our model, evaluated with the fasttext embeddings as gold standard, improved from 76% to 89%. Analyses of the errors made by the model clarified that 7.5% of errors are due to overabundance (and hence not true errors), and that 16.5% of the errors involved exchanges of semantically highly similar stems (lexemes). Our results indicate, first, that the semantics of Finnish noun inflection are more intricate than assumed thus far, and second, that these intricacies can be captured with surprisingly high accuracy by a simple generating model based on imputed semantic vectors for lexemes, inflectional features, and interactions of inflectional features.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",34,2022

We asked English monolinguals to learn 40 Cantonese words (20 verbs and 20 nouns). In two studies, we found support for the gist traces of congruent gestures being movement: participants who saw congruent gestures while hearing Cantonese words thought they had seen more verbs than participants in any other condition. However, gist traces were unrelated to the accurate recall of either nouns or verbs. In both studies, learning Cantonese words accompanied by congruent gestures tended to interfere with the learning of nouns (but not verbs). In Study 2, we ruled out the possibility that this interference was due either to gestures conveying representational information in another medium or to distraction from moving hands. We argue that gestures can interfere with learning foreign language words when they represent the referents (e.g., show shape or size) because learners must interpret the hands as something other than hands.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",51,2022

Speakers of both languages produced fewer gestures when addressing the superior, reduced their gesture space, decreased the encoding of manner, and reduced the use of character-viewpoint gestures. We see the decrease in gesture frequency and the less frequent encoding of manner as indicators of lower levels of iconicity when talking with status superiors.

This study serves to look into the water demand and supply issues by analyzing the trend and relationship between demand and supply of water in Langat catchment of Peninsular Malaysia, evaluating the current water availability and water demand for different sectors, such as agriculture, industry, and domestic. Using and analyzing the status of future scenarios of the water supply system and then evaluate them to make recommendations for these different future scenarios using an Integrated Water Resource Modelling tool called Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) by obtaining meteorological, population and climate data from relevant authorities and entering the data into WEAP which will simulate results based on the data input and scenarios suggested by the users. The results obtained from the simulation has shown that an increase in population growth rate will result in increased demand for water as shown where in 2009 the demand for water is 364 million cubic meters (MCM) and in 2040 it is 582 MCM. Low population growth rate however shows that as population growth rate decreases demand and unmet demand for water decreases. For the current account year (2009), the unmet demand for both scenarios is 198 MCM and for the last year of scenarios of 2040, the unmet water demand for the reference scenario is 229 MCM and that of the low population growth rate scenario is 137 MCM. On other hand, the change in climate scenario with reduced precipitation will result in less water input received by the Langat catchment hence leading to rise in unmet water demands and rise in water demands as well. Hence this study will help water management authorities to plan and allocate available resources accordingly so that it does not affect water availability for future generations.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",11,2022

All rights reserved.Reducing water and energy consumption is an essential condition for reducing the operational costs of water supply systems (WSS). The use of pumping systems driven by variable frequency drives (VFD) is one of the most suitable alternatives to optimize the pressurization of the distribution networks and, consequently, reduce the consumption of electricity and water losses. This article aims to analyze the performance of oversized pumps, driven with variable frequency drives, from WSS. The work was carried out in two experimental setups that have oversized pumps. The methodology consisted of evaluating data collected in experimental tests using hydraulic and electric meters. Tests were realized for different operating conditions of the systems, with the variation of the rotation of the pumps, in order to obtain the pump efficiency curve according to the VFD output frequency. The results demonstrated that the use of variable frequency drives proved to be an alternative to increase the energy efficiency of the evaluated systems. It was observed that the highest efficiencies were recorded in the lowest frequency bands (30 Hz and 35 Hz), while in the values close to the nominal frequency (45 Hz to 60 Hz) there is little variation in the efficiency values.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2022

All rights reserved.There has been a ton of debate on developing goals and the conflicts regarding environmental preservation. In the wastewater treatment industry, biochar seems to appear as a low-cost and environmentally friendly alternative because of its high porosity and adsorbent capacity. This study used the Scopus database to map articles on the topic through a systematic methodology and screening. The results demonstrate the approach researchers are giving to biochar adsorbing characteristics. It was observed that research about biochar applied to wastewater is recent and shortage. China and India were the countries that most published about it. Sewage sludge was the most common biomass used for biochar production, and pyrolysis temperature remained mainly at 300º C to 700 ºC. Also, the removal of heavy metals was the greater purpose of the studies. Finally, this mapping described biochar formation and its use as an adsorbent for wastewater treatment purposes, providing important data for directing future studies.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",23,2022

WTP A uses either direct filtration or flotation– filtration depending on the turbidity of raw water. WTP B has two independent treatment lines, a direct filtration and a conventional treatment line. Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts were identified by direct immunofluorescence microscopy and confirmed by DAPI staining and phase-contrast microscopy. Both protozoa were detected in water treated by direct filtration (WTP A and B) and flotation–filtration (WTP A). The absence of cysts and oocysts in chlorinated water does not exclude risks, as the limitations of concentration and identification techniques must be considered. These results reinforce the importance of monitoring protozoa in water destined for public supply, and the optimization of water treatment processes to produce low turbidity water.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",61,2022

The research method was qualitative with a library research approach, which collected a variety of relevant literature according to the topic of study. This study concludes that the concept of national fiqh has an orientation to unity and integrity in maintaining national sovereignty wrapped with nationalism. National fiqh’s relevance and religious moderation become a mutually reinforcing synergy because national fiqh seeks to build a nationalist humanistic paradigm to reduce differences. Then, the actualization of national fiqh in building Indonesia’s religious moderation is the appreciation of the teachings of Islam in a complex and contextualist manner, not merely normative or dogmatic, strengthened by the process of cultivating moderate, fair, tolerant, humanist, ethical, religious, and nationalist attitudes.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",81,2022

All rights reserved.Ensuring acceptable comfort conditions in quality outdoor spaces is nowadays one of the major concerns of urban design. Various paving materials contribute to this quality. Several studies have examined their optical and thermal properties, but few of them have addressed the negative impacts of a random choice of these materials on the thermal profile, especially in Jijel on the southern shore of the Mediterranean. This study aims to highlight the paving material’s contribution to the emergence of microclimates that are not always favorable to users. The thermal environment of two outdoor spaces with different paving materials was simulated and evaluated using the physiological equivalent temperature index through the RayMan model. The simulation results, validated by measurements and a questionnaire survey conducted in winter and summer 2019, revealed large variability in air temperatures for the studied paving materials. Air temperatures do not systematically follow the surface temperature profile, let alone the corresponding sky opening factors. Slate recorded the highest surface temperature (50.3°C), with a difference of up to 14.8°C from marble. Grassed surfaces and shade dampened the impact of radiation three times more than tiled surfaces. The peak air temperature (33 °C) is recorded for the tiled surfaces. It is reduced by 1°C for grassy surfaces and by up to 3.1°C for marbled surfaces. These results can therefore alert decision-makers to the need for an appropriate choice of paving materials for outdoor spaces that can favorably impact their thermal profile.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",39,2022

All rights reserved.Currently, huge amount of waste materials are being generating from different industries on the world. Among these plastic waste bottle is the most dangerous materials to the environment which needs solution. Ethiopia is on the verge of quick industrial development in different areas, along with high population growth. This development is an evident increase in the consumption of plastic bottle water. A disposal of huge consumed plastic bottles cause an environmental hazard and are considered non-biodegradable materials. The solution to this problem is reprocessing these non-biodegradable materials to save natural resources and minimizing environmental effects. This paper assessed the technique on how plastic waste materials can be reused in road construction. In this study, the plastic waste was used as an additive in the mix with 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10% by weight of optimum bitumen content. The addition of plastic waste improved the workability of bitumen by reducing the ductility and improving the penetration and softening point. Also, the addition of plastic content (pc) to the mix improved the Marshall Stability, stripping resistance and rutting resistance. Conversely, plastic waste has an impact on the fatigue resistance of the mixture if it is added excessively. Finally, the addition of plastic waste could be applicable in stripping resistance if it is added up to 5% to the neat bitumen.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",29,2022

All rights reserved.The hierarchical thinking concept in the Islamic education field is based on theological and philosophical beliefs. Up to now, this concept is not yet proven scientifically and neurobiologically. As a result, Islamic education does not yet have a learning taxonomy that accommodates the effective and spiritual aspects of developing students' intellectual potential. Consequently, it forced its system to apply Bloom’s taxonomy which focuses only on the cognitive part. With the rising of new theories, especially neuro-theology, neuro-philosophy, and neuro-education, emerge the opportunities to connect hierarchical thinking in Islamic education with these three theories. This research aims to compile a learning taxonomy of Islamic education based on neuroscience, accommodating the emotional, intellectual, and spiritual aspects. This research is a systematic review, which integrates, interprets, and synthesizes the hierarchical thinking concept with neuro-theology, neuro-philosophy, and neuro-education. The result shows that hierarchical thinking in Islamic education has neuro-physiological with six brain components: temporal lobe, parietal association cortex-temporal-occipital, limbic system, cingulate gyrus, prefrontal context, and prefrontal association cortex. These six components of the brain have relevance to hierarchical thinking and bloom taxonomy, namely remember (dzikir), understand (nazhr), apply (‘ilm-amal), evaluate (muhasabah); analyze (fikr), and create (ijtihad). Thus, the brain's six components and hierarchical thinking can be narratively synthesized into a learning taxonomy of Islamic education. In the future, this finding could become theoretical discourse because hierarchical thinking, neuro-theology, neuro-philosophy, and neuro-education emerge the further development of learning taxonomy in Islamic education.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",91,2022

This increase is expected in urban agglomerations composed of residences. The production of energy in the residential area has been discussed when talking about self-sufficiency and clean and sustainable energy. An aggravating factor in the context of forms of energy generation is the great impact of burning fossil fuels that release polluting gases when producing electricity. The present study sought to discuss, based on the literature, the use of photovoltaic panels in the generation of clean energy in homes as an alternative to conventional means. Therefore, the methodology used was based on the search for scientific studies in databases about the proposed theme. A bibliographic survey was carried out in order to obtain studies that would support the research. Studies in the databases Periódicos CAPES, Scholar Google and Scopus were found and selected based on certain criteria. Therefore, it was found that the use of photovoltaic panels in the generation of energy for homes is promising in reducing other energy sources. Several studies show the viability of this type of energy in homes in Brazil, which has a large availability of daily sunlight for its operation. However, the technology in question still has a high implementation cost, which may decrease with government incentives and a decrease in the values of its components.

Financial constraints, difficult rural terrain, inefficient policy, and a lack of industrial community development have all contributed to the grid expansion problem in these areas. These areas are energy-deficient, and their energy demands to keep up with cutting-edge communication technology are constantly rising. As a result, rural areas are confronted with the issue of charging. Consequently, many rural residents are forced to rely on diesel/petrol generators or travel long distances and pay a premium to have their mobile phones charged. Thus, this paper proposes an off-grid solar-powered charging system as an alternative, sustainable solution to meet rural mobile phone energy demand. The methodology employed six-tier architectural features, with the economic comparison metric based on net present value and payback period. Furthermore, the proposed model's performance analysis revealed that the charging rate is dependent on the phone battery type and charger type. Furthermore, the off-grid mobile charging system has a higher net present value ($20,658US) and a shorter payback period of 2.5 years than the alternative investment of a gasolne generator.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",23,2022

METHODS We performed a retrospective cohort study with age-sex matched case-control using data from the 2014-2016 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which was administered to South Korean adults (n=320). Individuals were categorized into quartiles based on accelerometer-measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Demographic and physical characteristics, waist circumference, visceral adiposity index, blood pressure, lipid profiles, and TG/HDL-C were observed. The associations between MVPA status and cardiometabolic disease risk factors as well as metabolic syndrome were determined using multiple logistic regression. RESULTS For the waist circumference, SBP, DBP, MBP, visceral adiposity, triglyceride, and a surrogate estimate of insulin resistance, the Q1 and Q2 groups had higher means compared with the Q3 and Q4 groups. HDL-C was higher in the Q3 and Q4 groups compared to the Q1 and Q2 groups. Odds ratios for cardiometabolic disease risk factors and metabolic syndrome decreased in a curvilinear manner with the increasing quartile of MVPA. CONCLUSIONS Adults with higher MVPA participation were strongly associated with cardiometabolic disease risk factors and metabolic syndrome.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': 'December 2022', 'day': '31'}",71,2022

Although it is most commonly found on the axilla, it can also present on the thighs, perineum, vulva, inframammary region, and groin. EBT mimicking a Bartholin’s abscess is extremely rare. Case presentation: Here, we report the case of a 31-year-old nulliparous woman who presented to our gynecology clinic with a complaint of right-sided vulvar swelling. An initial diagnosis of Bartholin’s abscess was made after clinical examination. This was surgically removed using marsupialization. However, following histopathological & immuno-histochemical evaluation, a confirmatory diagnosis of ectopic breast tissue was made. Conclusion: Indeed, our case re-emphasizes the absolute need for histopathological examination of every tumor notwithstanding the nature of the presentation, site of occurrence, and/or initial diagnosis. Furthermore, although rare, EBT should be considered an important differential in tumors of the vulva.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",13,2022

METHODS Along with a sequential mixed method design, qualitative researches were conducted (a literature review on brand authenticity and the inherent value of sport, 5 one-to-one expert interviews, and a Delphi survey of 10 researchers). Based on the qualitative research results, an EFA (n=304), 2 times CFA (1st: n=304, 2nd: n=311), and correlation analysis using the other scale (brand relationship quality, brand attachment, brand credibility) were conducted to test reliability, construct validity, and criterion-related validity. RESULTS In the qualitative research results, 8 dimensions with 36 items were extracted; however 6 dimensions (originality, connectedness, legitimacy, authority, sport spirit, and expertise) with 28 items were identified as appropriate structures from EFA and CFA, and the relations between all the dimensions and other scales related to consumer attitude were statistically significant in the correlation analysis. CONCLUSIONS The findings suggest that the scale in this study could provide a new and specific perspective on sport brand authenticity, which is constructed using a general aspect and a sport specific aspect, and an understanding of the concept of sport brand authenticity in other sport industries.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': 'December 2022', 'day': '31'}",56,2022

We, therefore, evaluated antimalarial preferences, tolerability, and cost of the ACTs among adult patients attending the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Nigeria. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted among adult patients and their caregivers at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Nigeria, using a semi-structured questionnaire. Their preferred antimalarial medication, previous use of antimalarial monotherapies, current ACT use; cost considerations, and adverse effects profile were sought. Result: Six hundred respondents were recruited with a mean age of 41.4±16.3years and M/F ratio of 1.4. The majority (88.0 %), reported that they had between 1-5 episodes of malaria fever in a year. Only 28.2% received doctors’ prescriptions while 85.8% purchased their antimalarial medications from a pharmacy. Sixty percent of the respondents used at least one ACT; mainly Artemether-Lumefantrine (AL) 312 (52.0%). Only 9.3% reported previous adverse effects with the ACTs with 4.0% of respondents discontinuing their medications. The mean (SD) cost of purchasing ACTs was 1,516.47±760.3 (3.65 USD) Naira. Conclusion: This study showed adult patients’ preference for the ACTs, especially Artemether-Lumefantrine despite some inclination towards antimalarial monotherapies and parenteral route. There was also a high rate of use of malaria presumptive treatment, but only a few reported adverse effects. There is a need to make ACTs affordable because the cost is still presently high for most Nigerians.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",39,2022

This study aimed to identify the cause of QE in golf putting and to present an efficient practice method for improving putting skills. METHODS Thirty participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups. Each group practiced golf putting in different ways for two days. RESULTS The QE group showed a significant difference in putting scores, which was higher than that of the control group. The visual-occlusion group showed no difference compared to the other groups in terms of putting scores. The QE group showed a significant difference in terms of QE in the retention and competition tests compared to the pretest. The control group tended to have a slightly longer QE in competition tests compared to the pretest. The visual-occlusion group showed no statistically significant difference in QE based on the period. All three groups had significantly longer swing times over the selected period. There was no significant difference in terms of the alpha power of the occipital lobe based on group and period. CONCLUSIONS The position of the visual-occlusion group became stable. However, the QE did not lengthen. The QE group had a longer QE. Furthermore, the control group that practiced with their eyes open tended to have longer QE. Therefore, QE may be related to visual-based cognitive processing rather than postural-kinematics.

His embrace of these new technologies included pasting in and coloring the twelve single-leaf Large Passion cycle engravings of Israel van Meckenem into a manuscript book of hours (Paris, BnF, lat. 1173) that he was illustrating for Charles, a practice that allows us to see how he chose to enhance certain details and even add new ones that radically altered the meaning of the scene. In many of his illuminations done for the Valois couple, Testard had enjoyed adding dogs to scenes both to appeal generally to the contemporary fashion for dogs in scenes of courtly domestic life and to express his own moral and religious convictions on the topics of sexual license or marital fidelity. In the BnF hours of Charles of Angoulême, however, we see these dogs put to a new use. In Testard's reworking of the Apostle Peter's denial of Jesus in the Interrogation before Annas print and in the Crowning with Thorns print (with a subtext of the biblical Malchus' failure to acknowledge Jesus' miraculous healing of his severed ear), we can see how Testard brilliantly reworks existing dogs though color, expression, and body language to express his disapproval of religious ingratitude.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",113,2022

All rights reserved.Sleep problems during childhood affect child development; thus, early screening and intervention are necessary. Considering that the Japanese sleep culture differs from that of Western countries (e.g., co-sleeping), we developed the Japanese Sleep Questionnaire for Preschoolers (JSQ-P) to screen for sleep problems in Japanese children. To adapt the JSQ-P for children in Tibet, which has a similar sleep culture as that of Japan, we examined the usefulness of the Chinese version of the JSQ-P (JSQ-P-C). Approximately 961 children aged 3–6 years attending kindergarten in Qinghai Province, China, were included in this study. The factor structure and reliability of the JSQ-P-C were evaluated using exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Factors were extracted using principal component analysis, and varimax rotation was applied. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach’s α. The heterotrait–monotrait ratio of correlations (HTMT) assessed the discriminant validity of each factor. The following eight subscales were obtained: “Insomnia,” “Restless legs syndrome (RLS),” “Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA),” “Excessive daytime sleepiness,” “Morning symptoms,” “Daytime behavior,” “Sleep deprivation,” and “Sleep habit.” JSQ-P-C showed good internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.917, 39 items). Cronbach's α for each item were distributed between 0.61 and 0.86. Owing to low factor loading, the item “Gets more than two naps” was excluded. EFA was conducted with 38 items and the results showed that Bartlett’s test of sphericity was significant (x2 value=15503.216, p< .001), Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin was 0.938, and the cumulative contribution ratio was 58.35%. The HTMT value of any two factors was < 0.85. “Sleep habits” showed a significant difference in terms of age. Four-year-old girls scored significantly higher than four-year-old boys in “Insomnia,” “RLS,” “Excessive daytime sleepiness,” and “Morning symptoms”. Contrastingly, three-year-old boys scored significantly higher in “OSA” than similarly aged girls. The JSQ-P-C is a valid questionnaire with good internal consistency that can be used for Tibetan children.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",40,2022

All rights reserved.Almost all vertebrate cells, including neurons, extrude a single primary cilium, which is a biosensor organelle. The dysfunction of this organelle leads to defective Hedgehog signaling and subsequent developmental abnormalities and syndromic disorders termed ciliopathies. A subset of G protein-coupled receptors, including serotonin receptor type 6 (Htr6), somatostatin receptor type 3 (Sstr3) and melanin-concentrating hormone receptor type 1 (Mchr1), are known to localize at primary cilia of neurons. Exogenous expression of Htr6 has been shown to induce elongation of primary cilia in cultured cells and in developing cortical neurons. However, the molecular mechanism by which Htr6 expression elongates primary cilia remains unknown. In this study, we investigated whether elongation of primary cilia by Htr6 expression is dependent on cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), which is an interacting partner of Htr6. hTERT-RPE1 (RPE1) cells transfected with Htr6 showed elongated cilia, while those transfected with Sstr3 and Mchr1 displayed primary cilia with a normal length. In CDK5-knockout RPE1 cell lines established by the CRISPR/Cas9 system, the elongation of cilia evoked by Htr6 expression was dramatically attenuated. This elongation by Htr6 expression was also attenuated by treatment with the CDK5 inhibitor roscovitine. Furthermore, exogenous expression of CDK5 in CDK5-knockout cells partially restored Htr6-evoked elongation of cilia. Our results demonstrate that elongation of primary cilia elicited by Htr6 expression is mediated by CDK5.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",48,2022

All rights reserved.Background Visit-to-visit heart rate variability (VVV-HR) has been associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes. We aimed to determine the predictive value of VVV-HR for adverse clinical outcomes in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF). Methods We used data from a prospective multicenter AF registry of 27 hospitals in Thailand during 2014 to 2017. After the baseline visit, patients were followed up every 6 months until 3 years. VVV-HR was calculated from the standard deviation of heart rate data from baseline visit and every follow-up visit. VVV-HR was categorized into four groups according to the quartiles. Clinical outcomes were all-cause death, ischemic stroke/systemic embolism(SE), and heart failure. Cox proportional hazardmodels were used for multivariable analysis. Results There were a total of 3,174 patients (mean age: 67.7 years; 41.8% female). The incidence rates of all-cause death, ischemic stroke/SE, and heart failure were 3.10 (2.74-3.49), 1.42 (1.18-1.69), and 2.09 (1.80-2.42) per 100 person-years respectively. The average heart rate was 77.8±11.0 bpm and the average of standard deviation of heart rate was 11.0±5.9 bpm. VVV-HR Q4 was an independent predictor of all-cause death, ischemic stroke/SE, and heart failure with adjusted hazard ratios of 1.45 (95% confidence interval: 1.07-1.98), 2.02 (1.24-3.29), and 2.63 (1.75-3.96), respectively. VVV-HR still remained a significant predictor of clinical outcomes when analyzed based on coefficient of variation and variability independent of mean. Conclusion VVV-HR is an independent predictor for adverse clinical outcomes in patients with AF. A J-curve appearance was demonstrated for the effect of VVV-HR on all-cause death.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",36,2022

Lesser known is that these varieties also employ intonation for multiple communicative functions, ranging from indexing a speaker’s socio-cognitive information (such as emotions and attitudes) to signaling various linguistic information (such as asking questions, marking focus, and encoding prosodic structure). This paper reviews the multiplexing of lexical tone and intonation into the same melodic f0 signal. The main empirical focus is on Standard Chinese; whenever possible, comparisons are made across Sinitic varieties (such as Shanghai Wu Chinese and Cantonese). I will show that lexical tone constrains the changes of f0 for intonation. How tone and intonation interact, however, varies across communicative contexts and language varieties, which is also reflected in how listeners utilize the f0 information to decode the melodic pitch signal during speech processing. From a cross-linguistic viewpoint, findings on intonation in Sinitic varieties suggest 1) the need for detailed acoustic and perceptual studies to understand the subtle f0 modifications for intonation in tone languages, and 2) the importance of a comparative approach to understanding the similarities and differences of intonation in tone languages.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",124,2022

The present study investigates the slope failure mechanism’s relationship with slope material compositions. Hence, sediment samples of 25 landslides were collected along the road corridors. These samples were collected from the Lesser and Greater Himalayan ranges and rock formations. The sediment was collected from the active landslides to understand particle size, clay content, moisture content, mineral composition, crystallographic structures, and the influence of geomorphic processes on the landslide failure processes. The samples were analyzed using a sieve, X-ray Diffractometry (XRD), and Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to accomplish the study’s objectives. The analysis indicates that the Lesser Himalayan meta-sedimentary rock formations have a high composition of fine and medium-size particles, lesser quartz mineral compositions with calcite, and a highly crushed and fractured presence, conchoidal fractures types of morphological features. Micrographs obtained from the schist and phyllite rock of the Lesser Himalayan origin shows highly sheared and crushing, crystal overgrowth; and, in turn, have a higher susceptibility to landslides. The relationship between slope materials and instability has shown a definite pattern in the study area. The debris flow and slump have a comparatively higher percentage of clay and silt compared to debris fall, debris slide, and rockfall.

Positive effects of CLIL for target language proficiency development may therefore be due in part to this cognitive or academic selection effect. Can the target language skills of pupils with lower scholastic attainment – a group which, in several educational contexts, has less access to CLIL programs – also benefit from the CLIL approach? This two-year longitudinal quasi-experimental research, part of a larger study, focused on the development of oral proficiency skills of three cohorts of 603 pre-vocational pupils in 25 classes in the Netherlands in both CLIL and non-CLIL programs. Despite the lack of explicit school-based selection procedures for pre-vocational pupils’ participation in CLIL, there were significant differences in favor of the CLIL groups in the initial levels of English oral proficiency, fluency, and Willingness to Communicate.

Certainty, doubt or uncertainty is inferred by hearers in an interactional context. In a sample of audio-video recorded interviews, the occurrences of this DM were classified by meaning, and association tests between meanings and linguistic factors (pronoun realization, polarity, position in utterance), real-world features (type of evidence from which the speaker says something, and discursive topic), prosody (F0, intensity and duration), and facial expressions were carried out. Differences that distinguish these factors were identified among certainty, doubt and uncertainty uses. The certainty meaning of (eu) acho que was associated with pronoun presence, more formality and topics in which the speaker had direct evidence. Uncertainty and doubt were associated with pronoun absence, less formality and topics in which the speaker did not have direct evidence. Patterns of intensity and duration acted to distinguish the certainty, doubt and uncertainty meanings of (eu) acho que. In a conditional decision tree, the position in utterance, presence of a pronoun, type of speaker’s evidence, discursive topic, and duration helped to disambiguate the meanings of (eu) acho que. These results suggest the relevance of a multilevel approach to describe DM, in different languages, at least with respect to mental state verbs.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",47,2022

As sociosensitive and socioactive assistance systems advance, the question arises whether a machine’s behavior should include considerations regarding social appropriateness. However, the concept of social appropriateness is difficult to define, as it is determined by multiple aspects. Thus, to date, a unified perspective, encompassing and combining multidisciplinary findings, is missing. When translating results from HHI to HMI, it remains unclear whether such insights into the dynamics of social appropriateness between humans may in fact apply to sociosensitive and socioactive assistance systems. To shed light on this matter, we propose the Five Factor Model of Social Appropriateness (FASA) which provides a multidisciplinary perspective on the notion of social appropriateness and its implementation into technical systems. Finally, we offer reflections on the applicability and ethics of the FASA Model, highlighting both strengths and limitations of the framework.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",95,2022

This aspect has not yet been widely explored, and the current study breaks new ground by demonstrating that the analysis of gaze and gesture can shed substantial light on the pragmatic functions of filled pauses and other pausing phenomena. Filled pauses (FPs) serve several pragmatic functions in speech, mainly planning but also turn-holding and emphasis, and their use is also highly determined by register and setting. This research explores the different pragmatic functions of FPs by analyzing their distribution in two different communication settings (conversation vs presentation setting), combining a quantitative and a qualitative methodology, following Kosmala & Crible’s (2021) study on the same data. Particular attention was paid to the co-occurring gestural activity of uh/ums and gaze behavior.

The results showed that ES-D3 cell viability was lower than 3T3 cell viability when a centrifugal force was applied in the initial phase of culture. In the future, the influence on cell differentiation in addition to cell proliferation should be examined.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",28,2022

All rights reserved.In a phototoxicity test, a solar simulator with a tungsten lamp, of which the calorific power is great, is used, but, concerning the LED-type irradiator that we developed, the influence of heat on the cultured cells can be mostly ignored, and an experiment may be conducted while placing the LED closer to the cultured cells. No study has examined the distance between cultured cells and a light source. In this study, we established the distance between cultured cells and a LED: short and long distance groups, and investigated the 3T3 cell viability using an MTT assay to clarify the influence on the phototoxicity level in the Bis-GMA + Camphorquinone (CQ) and Bis-GMA groups. The results showed that cell viability rapidly increased with an increase in the dilution ratio in the long distance group. However, in the short distance group, it only slightly increased with an increase in the dilution ratio. In the Bis-GMA group, photoirradiation slightly influenced cell viability. There was a marked change in phototoxicity related to the distance between the LED and cells. As light-cured composite resin contains a large amount of nanofiller, the influence of composition with a nanomaterial should be examined in the future.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",25,2022

All rights reserved.Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly mortal disease and one of the most malignant gastrointestinal tumors. Our previous studies have demonstrated that phosphorylation of eIF2a, which occurs during endoplasmic reticulum stress, suppresses cell invasive capacity. However, the relationship between radiation-induced ER stress and cell invasion is not well understood. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the effect of combining irisin with radiation therapy on apoptosis and metastasis of pancreatic cancer cells, and in this study, we also investigated the mechanism of the effect of irisin and radiation therapy on pancreatic cancer cells, and we hope that this approach may improve the survival rate of pancreatic cancer. Our data suggest that the combination of irisin and radiation therapy can inhibit the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells through inhibition of calmodulin (CaM), and identified the Ca2+ CaM signaling pathway, which may play a key role in the induction of irisin and radiation therapy in role in the era where malignant tumors have entered the era of individual therapy and the expression status of specific targets has become the patient's chemotherapy regimen, which also allows the combination of irisin and radiation therapy to provide new ideas for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2022', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2022'}, 'day': '31'}",30,2022

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 232 participants with SBMA. Participants provided input regarding 18 themes and 208 symptoms that affect patients with SBMA. Participants were asked about the relative importance of each symptom, and analysis was conducted to determine how age, education, disease duration, CAG repeat length, and ambulation status relate to symptom prevalence. Results: Hip, thigh, or knee weakness (96.5%), fatigue (96.5%), problems with hands and fingers (95.7%), and limitations with walking (95.7%) were the themes with the highest prevalence in the study population. Ambulatory status was associated with the prevalence of 9 of the 14 themes, and CAG repeat length and education were each associated with 4 of 14 themes. The prevalence of fatigue was reduced in those with a lower CAG repeat length and increased with a longer disease duration. Younger patients reported a higher prevalence of emotional issues.

All rights reserved.Reflecting on the confines and the opportunities that the concepts of national identity and the artistic canon entail, this article offers a comparative analysis of two Ukrainian filmmakers with multicultural backgrounds: Kira Muratova and Eva Neymann. While film critics have speculated about Muratova’s ‘disciples’, frequently citing Eva Neymann among them, Neymann herself has openly dismissed any idea of being an epigone – a position perhaps rooted in the “anxiety of influence” that artists often experience with respect to heir forerunners. Nonetheless, a thread of continuity is discernible in Neymann’s oeuvre, not only through the shared backdrop of Odesa but also in the nuanced parallels in visual composition, narrative, and pacing that recall Muratova’s works while maintaining Neymann’s unique cinematic voice. Employing Harold Bloom’s theory of influence alongside Elizabeth Bronfen’s concept of crossmapping, this article aims to illuminate the dynamics of productive, albeit not necessarily conscious, influence within the cinematic worlds of the two filmmakers. Focusing on Neymann’s debut feature, By the River (2007), and her subsequent film House with a Turret (2012), the analysis reveals how Muratova’s iconography resonates within these works. It also examines how cine-poetic lineage is sustained through aesthetic formalisation, circulation, appropriation, quotation, and refiguration of images and gestures. This contributes to the development of a national cinematic canon and offers an understanding of national cinematic identity as an entity in flux.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",null,2023

All rights reserved.In the late winter of 2022, just before the brutal Russian invasion of Ukraine, a screening of Kira Muratova's film The Long Farewell (1971) was scheduled in one of Vilnius' cinemas. When the invasion took place, the screening was cancelled, motivated by censorship of Russian cultural products. This misunderstanding was quickly corrected by the simple fact that Muratova's cinema is Ukrainian cinema. But this incident is an example of a wider historical misunderstanding regarding Ukrainian cinema and especially Muratova’s films. The main aim of this paper is to challenge the assumption that Muratova belongs to Russian cultural tradition through an analysis of three of Muratova's melodramatic films – Brief Encounters (1967), The Long Farewell (1971) and The Asthenic Syndrome (1989). In the current analysis I show that although these three melodramas do not explicitly refer to Ukrainian identity, the search for a more universal and humanistic morality through melodramatic temporality is closely linked to Ukraine. This can be seen in the reception of the films by the local Soviet authorities, which resulted in strict censorship and repression of Muratova's creative possibilities. I argue that while these films are in stark contrast to the official guidelines of the artistic dogmas of the Soviet state apparatus, they formulate a vision of life that resembles what Stanley Cavell calls moral perfectionism. However, Muratova's films not only adhere to Cavell's legacy but by showing the negative of Cavell's vision – what happens when members of society do not have the means to pursue an authentic moral life – she expands and updates Cavell's thought. The dialogue between Muratova's cinema and Cavell's philosophy is important not only because it extends and universalizes Cavell's notion of moral perfectionism, but more importantly because it shows a strategy of temporal resistance that is not based on folkloric references and filmed landscapes, but on the moral and philosophical human need for an autonomous life. As can be clearly seen in Muratova’s films, one of the necessary conditions for such a life is political liberty.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",null,2023

When the theoretical works of Turkish music are analyzed, it is seen that from the 15th century onwards, the perdes started to be referred to with special names that remind the makam according to the makam in which they are used, instead of names indicating degrees. The perde ""sabâ"", which is the subject of this study, was referred to in the same way as the makam in many theoretical works until the introduction of the Arel-Ezgi-Uzdilek (AEU) sound system. In this study, in which historical and computational musicology methods are used together, firstly, the historical process of the perde ""sabâ"" until the AEU theory is examined. Then, the perde sabâ used in Tanburi Cemil Bey's sabâ taksim performed on the kemençe is examined and frequency analyzed. The values of the frequencies determined in hertz are first converted to cents and then to Holder's coma in order to compare them with the values in AEU. With these perde analyzes made according to the movement of the melody, the region of use of the perde is determined. Thus, the differences between theory and performance are revealed and the definition of the concept of perde is opened to discussion. In all of the works analyzed in the study, it is seen that the perde sabâ is located between the perde çargâh and nevâ, and as the 20th century approaches, it is positioned closer to the perde nevâ. Similarly, in Tanburi Cemil Bey's performance, the perde sabâ is performed close to the perde nevâ and variations are observed in the interval values according to the melodical movement. With this research, it is aimed to bring the perde ""sabâ"" back into the literature. It is thought that this will contribute to the fields of Turkish music education, research and performance.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",44,2023

All rights reserved.This study aims to examine cyclical forms as a distinctive musical form. In this study, the term ‘cycle’ is used to denote a series of unique sections combined in genre, theme, or program of a musical composition. As a form and structure, cyclicality is specific to various types of musical compositions in the world music literature, including Suite, Sonata, Symphony, Chamber works (Trio, Quartet, etc.), vocal-symphonic pieces, as well as musical-stage genres like opera and ballet. The scope of the study is limited to Suite and Sonata forms, and featuring examples of cyclical forms found in the works of composers from the late 18th century to the early 20th century. The study employs a literature review method. In this context, an attempt has been made to provide a general assessment by utilizing national and international articles and books related to the subject. Additionally, compositions were analyzed in terms of their cyclical structure, tempo characteristics, and the tonal scheme of their sections. As a result of the research, it has been concluded that sections of music compositions constructed according to the cyclicality principle are unique in terms of form, interconnected under a common theme or genre umbrella and linked through dramatic development or program headings. The structure of compositions which employs cyclical forms are shaped based on the tempo contrast between sections. Additionally, in such compositions, the tonal relationship between sections (tonal unity or variations of tonal unity) plays a significant role. It is believed that this study will contribute to educational materials for undergradute musical form courses and provide scholarly research perspective of cyclical forms. Given their historical formation, classification and evolution, cyclical form genres are likely to illumiate new scientific studies, hence, it is considered that their study deserve a close attention.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",15,2023

Although in ancient regimes and cultures such as the Persian, Egyptian and Roman empires, the product of art sometimes functioned as an indicator of power and sometimes as an indicator of governance, the fact that the product of art was a part and tool of social, political or religious propaganda reached another stage in the twentieth century, especially with the development of mass media. Violin making is also affected by this process in which many artistic products turn into ""useful"" propaganda materials. The process that began in 1943 when Goebbels, Nazi Germany's Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, presented Japanese violinist Nejiko Suwa (1920-2021) with a violin allegedly made by Antonio Stradivari (1644-1737) is one of the most striking examples of the infiltration of propaganda into violin making. Based on the example of Goebbels and Suwa, this article examines how Stradivarius4 violins became objects of propaganda in the twentieth century.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2023

All rights reserved.This article aims to explore the improvisational taksims by celebrated Turkish ney virtuoso Niyazi Sayın within the Uşşak mode, highlighting the nuances of the segâh pitch and the Uşşak mode's progression. The primary objective of this study is to scrutinize the distinct characteristics and structures of taksims executed in the Uşşak mode, as well as the utilization of the segâh pitch within this context. Employing a musical analysis approach, the article dissects audio recordings of Niyazi Sayın's taksims in the Uşşak mode. The attributes of the segâh pitch and the Uşşak mode will be discerned through the application of music theory and analytical methods to Sayın's taksims. Additionally, a comprehensive review of Turkish music modes and progression concepts will serve as the foundational framework for this study. Analysis results reveal notable similarities and differences in Niyazi Sayın's taksims within the Uşşak mode, particularly in the utilization of the segâh pitch and progression characteristics. These findings will be expounded upon in intricate detail, shedding light on the intricate relationship between the segâh pitch and the Uşşak mode within Sayın's taksims, and their profound impact on the understanding of musical progression. This research highlights Niyazi Sayın's significant contributions through his taksims in the Uşşak mode, enhancing our understanding of the segâh pitch and Uşşak mode progression. The analysis of Sayın's taksims unveils fresh insights into the utilization of the Uşşak mode and the segâh pitch, thereby enriching our knowledge within the realm of Turkish music. Moreover, this study establishes a solid groundwork for future investigations, encouraging more comprehensive examinations of Turkish music modes and the concept of progression. Specifically, a deeper exploration of taksims performed by esteemed masters like Niyazi Sayın will provide a broader perspective on Turkish music theory and mode comprehension. Furthermore, the integration of such analyses into Turkish music education will enable students to grasp modes and the intricacies of progression more profoundly.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",4,2023

All rights reserved.Akın Özkan stands as one of the most important representatives of traditional Turkish art music of his time as a tanbur player, composer and educator. Özkan started traditional Turkish art music with tanbur lessons from Sadun Aksüt and continued his music studies in the most important associations and municipal conservatories of Istanbul. While serving as a tanbur player and choir conductor at Türkiye Izmir and Ankara Radio (TRT), his compositions were sung on records by the most renowned soloists of his time. After retiring from TRT, he became one of the first educators of the Ege University State Turkish Music Conservatory established in Izmir and worked in many administrative positions at the same institution. The findings about Akın Özkan’s life, covering the years 1987-2007, were conveyed by me personally, as his student, his assistant, and as an educator who always benefits from his experiences. While the universe of the study is composed of the evc-i şevk makam and the classical fasıl composed by composer and educator Akın Özkan, the sample consists of the genre and the formal analysis of, evc-i şevk kâr which he composed in the same makam and is the most important verbal genre. In this study, historical method, biographical analysis and document analysis methods were used. In the kâr whose genre and form analysis was performed with Onur Akdoğu's method, it was found that the form of evc-i şevk kâr was composed in a five-part alternating form as A+B+C+D+E+B'. The similarities and differences between the findings in Kantemiroğlu’s Edvârı regarding the methods and lyrics of the kârs and Özkan’s kârs were determined; it was observed that Özkan adhered to the tradition by giving great importance to harmony, and deviated from the tradition with the difference in his choice of methods and lyrics, and as a result, evaluations were made regarding his composition in the kârs genre. Due to the lack of sufficient academic studies on Akın Özkan, this study was carried out in order to contribute to music people working in the field of traditional Turkish art music by drawing attention to his artist identity and the evc-i şevk makam he compounded.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",22,2023

The overall system simulation was carried out using Matlab/Simulink, and the reliability of the control method was verified. The experimental results showed that when the tractor was tracked with the automatic control of a linear path under the condition of variable speed, the maximum deviation of the lateral position deviation was 12.7 cm, and the average absolute deviation was kept within 4.88 cm; the maximum deviation of the heading angle deviation was 5°, and the average absolute deviation was kept within 2°; the maximum value of the actual rotation angle was 3.13°, and the standard deviation of the fluctuation was within 0.84°. Under the conditions of constant speed and variable speed, using the joint sliding mode control method designed by the authors, the dual-objective joint control of lateral position deviation and heading angle deviation could be realized, the controlled overshoot was small, the controlled deviation was small after reaching a stable state, and the adaptability to speed factors was strong, which basically could meet the accuracy requirements of farmland operations.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",32,2023

The significant reduction of these areas due to urbanization is a pressing issue. The process of land take consumes not only land resources but also the connected ecosystems and the benefits generated for human society. Reducing the quantity of land taken is imperative, but preserving high-quality territories is essential to achieving sustainable development. Evaluating the quality of non-urbanized areas can be done by assessing the ecosystem services (ESs) provided by these areas. In this paper, the authors present a further step: an evolution and deepening of the previous methodology (published in 2020) to evaluate the quality of rural and urban green areas through the assessment of the ESs provided. The methodology first allows the identification of the ESs provided by different typologies of rural and urban green areas according to the common international classification of ESs (provisioning, regulation and maintenance, and cultural). Then, it allows the calculation of several singular indexes and a final composite quality index through the use of geographical information systems. An analytic hierarchy process was performed with the creation of different scenarios to consider the different importance of the singular indexes assigned by planners and communities involved. The methodology was applied to the province of Monza Brianza (Italy), for testing and validation purposes. The application to the municipality of Sovico, which is presented in this report, allowed for the identification of areas with higher quality in the different scenarios that were created to consider the relative importance of the territorial characteristics.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",41,2023

Design/method/approach – This study is field research with 225 subjects from UIN Syarif Hidayatullah (n = 115) and YARSI University (n = 110). The data collection instrument used two psychological scales, namely the spirituality scale and the stress scale. The data were analyzed using regression analysis techniques. Findings – The results showed that most students tended to experience moderate stress (n = 134), however, the number of students who experienced severe stress was greater than those with mild stress (n = 53 ‘severe stress’ > n = 38 ‘mild stress'). These results indicate that students should have a self-defense mechanism, namely spirituality. Moreover, the study found that spirituality had a significant negative relation with stress in medical students (r =-0.123, p = 0.00 and R2 = 0.263). It means that the higher the student’s spirituality, the lower the level of academic stress. The significance of the relationship between spirituality and academic stress has confirmed that spirituality in medical students serves as a form of self-protection mechanism to deal with factors that can trigger academic stress. However, the contribution of spirituality to stress was only 26.3%, while the rest (73.7%) were influenced by other variables outside this study. Low r and R2 scores also indicated that in dealing with academic stress, students rely not only on internal defense resources but also on external social and environmental supports. Research implications/limitations – This research has implications for promoting prevention programs designed by universities to improve the student’s ability to overcome obstacles during their medical learning process, such as involving the dimension of spirituality in managing the mental well-being of medical students in dealing with academic pressure. Originality/value – This research has significance in providing additional understanding of the positive impact of spirituality on the context of learning. The findings of this study have emphasized the importance of educational institutions paying attention to student self-protection mechanisms to prevent personal difficulties. The results showed that spirituality has a significant role in relieving stress in medical students.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",34,2023

This distribution is found across languages, speech genres, and within different parts of speech. The recurrence of such distributions is thought to reflect cognitive and/or communicative pressures and to facilitate language learning. However, research on Zipfian distributions has mostly been limited to spoken languages. In this study, we ask whether Zipfian distributions are also found across signed languages, as expected if they reflect a universal property of human language. We find that sign frequencies and ranks in three sign language corpora (BSL, DGS and NGT) show a Zipfian relationship, similar to that found in spoken languages. These findings highlight the commonalities between spoken and signed languages, add to our understanding of the use of signs, and show the prevalence of Zipfian distributions across language modalities, supporting the idea that they facilitate language learning and communication.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",103,2023

Contrastive stress is often taught using written texts that require learners to understand the content of the texts as well as to identify the pronunciation issues in reading those texts aloud. The decisions made for this study were driven by the target learner population, low-intermediate learners of English, who were very much less likely to be able to carry out both of these tasks.

We analyse the tensed interplay between critical perspectives in applied linguistics and the influence of academic neoliberalism. We develop our argument in three parts: (1) Academic critique and its emancipatory epistemologies are intertwined with established systems and coexist with mechanisms that perpetuate inequalities. (2) Inequalities in knowledge production reverberate in knowledge dissemination, where the hegemonic role of English as the language of academic publishing reinforces the unequal position of different actors in their academic fields. (3) These inequalities (that originate in institutional and gate-keeping infrastructures) extend to the validation of knowledge, which is entrenched in the audit culture that pervades academia and further reinforces neoliberal competitive dynamics.

Three main pedagogical innovations were key in obtaining the positive results. First, the hand gestures performed by the instructor closely mimicked the prosodic structure (i.e., the melodic and rhythmic features) of the target sentences.

Through a detailed case study, the paper shows that such negative reactions involve semiotic processes of linguistic and social differentiation that articulate the moralized persona of the author and the scientific value of his/her work. However, editors verbal hygiene attitudes are also intertwined with political concerns aimed at promoting the inclusion of scholars from the Global South.

Drawing upon ethnographic interviews and observations of self-identified Hanfu fans in Beijing, China, this paper analyzes how they, through invoking and shifting back and forth across multiple spatiotemporal scales, discursively enact collective and intimate identification among individuals, among Hanfu fan groups (on a local scale), and the general Chinese population (on a larger, national scale). This paper suggests that the great ancient China chronotope (GACC) has played a crucial role in establishing continuity between the present (or other time-spaces) and the ‘past,’ ultimately legitimizing the inseparable link between Hanfu groups and collectives and solidifying great China and collective identity ideologies. It also demonstrates that modern Chinese youth are internalizing the Chinese nationalist ideology in order to establish a sociocultural relationship of belonging to and sharing with Chinese collectives as a way to empower themselves to cope with uncertainty.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",49,2023

This reduction took place within two generations of native speakers. We compare the geographical and sociolinguistic situation with the majority of present-day Romani varieties, which still maintain the original two-way (masculine, feminine) gender system. By comparing these varieties with the few Romani varieties which also display reduction of their gender system, we show that the development of this particular typological change may be the outcome of the minority situation of Romani and its geographical proximity to a genderless language. However, as rural varieties do not exhibit the same kind of erosion, this is not a sufficient explanation; what also appears to play a role in the Romani case is the urban context of the change. This sociolinguistic factor might also be considered in other case studies on the loss of grammatical gender.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",80,2023

In high-risk patients with persistent AVB despite pharmacological treatment and endoscopic intervention, percutaneous transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting (TIPS) provides a minimally invasive salvage method to reduce portal pressure and control bleeding. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate factors influencing in-hospital mortality after salvage TIPS (sTIPS) in patients with exsanguinating variceal bleeding despite medical treatment and endoscopic intervention. METHODS: Clinical and laboratory data were analysed in all patients treated with sTIPS following failed endoscopic therapy for AVB between August 1991 and November 2020. Factors associated with and predictors of death were determined using bivariate analysis and univariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients (29 men, 5 women), mean age 52 years (range 31 - 80), received sTIPS for uncontrolled (n=11) or refractory (n=23) AVB. The causes of portal hypertension were alcohol-related (n=24) and non-alcohol-related cirrhosis. Salvage TIPS controlled bleeding in 32 patients, with recurrence in 1. Ten patients died in hospital (mean 4.8 days, range 1 - 10) of liver failure (n=4), multiorgan failure (n=3), alcoholic cardiomyopathy (n=2) and uncontrolled gastric variceal bleeding (n=1). On bivariate analysis, factors associated with death were Child-Pugh (C-P) score ≥10 (p=0.006), sodium Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD-Na) score ≥22 (p<0.001), ≥8 units of blood transfused (p<0.001), Sengstaken-Blakemore balloon tube placement (p<0.001), endotracheal intubation (p<0.001), inotropic support (p<0.001) and endoscopically uncontrolled bleeding (p<0.001). Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that the most significant predictors of mortality were inotrope dependency (odds ratio (OR) 134; p<0.001), endotracheal intubation (OR 99; p<0.001), endoscopically uncontrolled bleeding (OR 28; p=0.001), grade 3 ascites (OR 20.9; p=0.012) and C-P grade C (OR 8.8; p=0.011). CONCLUSION: Salvage TIPS controlled variceal bleeding in 94% of patients after failed endoscopic therapy with 29% in-hospital mortality. The most significant predictors of mortality were C-P grade C, grade 3 ascites, inotrope requirement, endotracheal intubation and endoscopically uncontrolled bleeding.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",null,2023

However, dermatology consultation services have remained active, offering care to patients admitted for non-cutaneous indications by other specialties. OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical spectrum and characteristics of inpatient dermatology diseases managed at a quaternary South African (SA) hospital. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed and analysed electronic records of all dermatology inpatients managed by dermatologists from 2015 to 2020 at Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital (IALCH) in Durban, South Africa. Demographic and clinical data on the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 10 dermatology diagnosis and admitting specialty were collected and analysed. RESULTS: A total of 4 867 patients were managed by the IALCH dermatology service during the study period. Females accounted for 2 527 (51.9%), while black African, coloured, Indian/Asian, white and unclassified patients constituted 3 146 (64.6%), 106 (2.2%), 1 129 (23.2%), 431 (8.9%) and 55 (1.1%), respectively. The median (interquartile range) age of the study population was 42.0 (28.0 - 58.0) years. Of 867 patients, 183 (3.8%) were dermatology inpatient admissions, whereas the remainder, 4 684 (96.2%), were seen as consults from other specialties. Most (1 010 (20.7%)) of the dermatology consults were received from plastic and reconstructive surgeons, while bacterial infections, decubitus ulcers and lower limb ulcers were the three most common referred diagnoses overall. CONCLUSION: A broad range of diagnoses is managed through the dermatology inpatient service, particularly as consultations.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the factors that impacted RIC during the PEPFAR transition in Western Cape Province, SA, in 2012. METHODS: We used aggregate data from 61 facilities supported by four non-governmental organisations from 2007 to 2015. The main outcome was RIC 12 months after antiretroviral therapy initiation for two periods - during PEPFAR and post PEPFAR. We used adjusted quantile regression to estimate the effect of the PEPFAR pull-out on RIC. RESULTS: Regression models (50th quantile) for 12-month RIC showed a 4.0% (95% CI -7.7 - -0.4%) decline in RIC post-direct service. Facilities supported by Anova/Kheth'impilo fared worst post PEFPAR, with a decline in RIC of -4.9% (95% CI -8.8 - -1.0%), while TB, HIV/AIDS, Treatment Support, and Integrated Therapy (that'sit) fared best (3.6% increase in RIC; 95% CI: -0.2 - 7.3%). There was a decrease in RIC when comparing urban with rural areas (-7.8%; 95% CI -12.8 - -2.9%). City of Cape Town combined with Western Cape Government health facilities showed a substantial decrease (-6.1%; 95% CI -10.6 - -1.7%), while community health clinic (v. central day clinics) declined (-6.4; 95% CI -10.6 - -2.1%) in RIC. We observed no RIC difference by facility size and a slight increase when two or more human resources transitioned from PEPFAR to the government. CONCLUSION: When PEPFAR funding decreased in 2012, there was a decrease in RIC. To ensure the continuity of HIV care when a major funder withdraws sufficient and stable transition resources, investment in organisations that understand the local context, joint planning and co-ordination are required.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",null,2023

When salient and social cues conflict, infants follow social information for referent selection. By comparing solo and joint object exploration, this study provides first evidence that joint actions modify the duration of infants' attention to objects not only during object play but also in a retention test. During object play, joint actions with a social partner sustain infants' attention to a referent. In the retention trials, joint actions affect infants' attention patterns by reducing their initial saliency bias.

Savings were also considered gharar even though the payments were not intended for customers or bank but channeled through charitable activities such as the construction of mosques and the provision of compensation for orphans and the poor. Therefore, the public was encouraged to conduct social charity activities through zakat, infaq, and sadaqah without mixing the process with activities prohibited by Islam.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",54,2023

These products are not officially recognised despite their potential benefits. The definition of sports food is not specified in EU legislation. While this does not preclude such products from proliferating, agreeing on how to define this would be helpful. The beneficial impact of sport, particularly elite sport, on the health of generations is indisputable. When it comes to recreational sports, the competitive spirit exists just as much. However, is it possible to achieve outstanding sports performance by only following general nutritional recommendations and using common foods? The author argues that this is not possible, and the purpose of this summary is to emphasise this point.

Vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) may accelerate empyema drainage and wound closure. Methods: In this study, we compared two cohorts of patients receiving open-window thoracostomy (OWT) with or without VAC dressing. We included patients with chronic or postresectional empyema with multiple comorbidities or in poor general condition or on immunosuppression. Results: Delayed wound closure by thoracoplasty was performed in 8 (28%) patients in the OWT group and 8 (53%) patients in the OWT-VAC group (OR 2.54; 95% CI: 0.704-9.168).

Diagnostic concerns currently relate mainly to concerns about possible malignancy. Reports in the literature describe the recurrence of endometriosis in the postmenopausal period as well as the occurrence of endometriosis de novo. The treatment of choice for symptomatic endometriosis in menopause is the surgical removal of all visible endometriotic tissue, as the risk of recurrence and conversion to malignancy is relatively high. Postmenopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is often used to relieve postmenopausal symptoms and prevent bone loss.

Their interpretations were pantheistic according to their opponent, the Shaykh al-Islām of Acheh, Nūr al-Dīn al-Rānīrī (d. 1658). Al-Rānīrī challenged the teachings of the Wujūdiyyah Sufis to cleanse Sufism from pantheistic views. The text chosen, al-Fatḥ al-Mubīn ‘alā ’l-Mulḥidīn (A Clear Victory against the Heretics) is a Jawi text written by al-Rānīrī before he left Acheh in 1446 for India. The Wujūdiyyah Sufis interpreted the Qur’ānic verses to support their ideas. In response, al-Rānīrī reinterpreted the same verses to demonstrate the flaws found in their teachings. Issues of reinterpretation, authoritative interpretation, and cogency are clearly expressed in the text. The article provides an overview of the seventeenth-century Malay Sufism which the contemporary scholars of the Islamics often ignore. The paper begins by giving a background of the controversy and proceeds to discuss arguments articulated by al-Rānīrī for a reinterpretation of the Qur’ānic texts misinterpreted by the Wujūdiyyah Sufis, in his quest for upholding the true Sufi view.

Objective: In the present study the ameliorative effect of silymarin was determined in a gentamicin-induced nephrotoxic model of rat. Methodology: This experimental animal study was carried out in the Department of Pharmacology at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka, Bangladesh from January 2014 to January 2015 for a period of one year. In this study nephrotoxicity was induced by administering gentamicin (80 mg/kg/day for 7 days) intraperitoneally. Silymarin was administered (500 mg/kg/day for 14 days) orally concomitantly with gentamicin (7 days) and sacrificed on 15th day. To determine nephrotoxicity and amelioration of nephrotoxicity as well as the status of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation; serum creatinine, serum urea, renal cortical reduced glutathione and malondialdehyde levels were estimated. Changes in renal architecture were estimated by histopathology of renal tissues. Results: Group (II) rats were injected gentamicin intraperitoneally for 7 days and sacrificed on 15th day showed significant (P< 0.001) increase of serum creatinine and urea level while there was significant (P< 0.001) reduction of renal cortical glutathione and increase (P< 0.001) in malondialdehyde concentration when compared to the control group (group I). This was supported by histological observations of H&E and PAS stained transverse section of renal cortex which suggested significant (P< 0.001) level of structural damage of renal cortex as evidenced from glomerular atrophy, tubular degeneration, presence of desquamated cellular debries and cast in the tubular lumen, mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltration. Statistically significant amelioration was observed in all the biochemical parameters which were supported by histology of renal cortex in silymarin treated group. Conclusion: The results from biochemical and histological observations of the present study indicate that silymarin was probably effective to ameliorate the signs of toxic damage to the renal cortex.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",21,2023

All rights reserved.-The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of different fasting periods on mortality of Litopenaeus vannamei post-larvae and the time it took to molt or die. The study applied an experimental design using 20-days-old post-larvae (PL), with a control group subjected to continuous feeding (CF) and 9 treatments (S2, S4, S6, S8, S10, S12, S14, S16, S18) with varying fasting periods, followed by continuous feeding. The time at which food deprivation resulted in death was analyzed for 50% of the post-larvae, even when they received food after fasting. Statistical analysis of time to molt identified 3 different groups (P < 0.05): group 1 with continuous feeding, group 2 with fasting periods of 2 and 4 days (S2, S4), and group 3 with fasting periods between 6-18 days (S6-S18). In control group with continuous feeding, the time to molt was estimated at about 3.44 ± 0.68 days. Time to death, showed 2 significantly different treatment groups (P < 0.05). In CF treatment, all PLs survived. The first group consisted of fasting tests for 2 and 4 days (S2, S4). The second group corresponded to fasting periods from S6 to S18 days, resulting in the shortest time to death with 71.43 and 100% of individuals dead. The PNR50 was estimated to be around 3.97 ± 0.31 days, demonstrating that fasting periods affected development and potentially caused death in PL of L. vannamei.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",40,2023

This paper presents the results of a preliminary study on the influence of the carbonation of concrete on its air permeability measured using the Torrent apparatus. Three batches of concrete made with CEM I cement and differing in the w/c ratio (0.45, 0.50, and 0.55) were tested. The influence of the relative humidity of concrete on the air permeability index kT was assessed using relationships available in the literature. It was shown that in carbonated concrete, these relationships need to be modified. The air permeability values obtained in tests are lower than the theoretical values calculated using the equation. The results obtained suggest that the effect of carbonation on the air permeability of concrete is significant and further research in this area is highly recommended.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",20,2023

In the contemporary evolution of religious comprehension, particularly in Aceh, the local community perceives cultural manifestations in worship as misguided. Therefore, the introduction of Islam Nusantara concept aims to rectify these misconceptions through cultural adjustment with Sharia, commonly referred to as Islamization. Considering these challenges, the role of ulemas should be examined by implementing and practicing fiqh law in the Aceh community. Furthermore, this study adopts qualitative and descriptive normative methods. Data are derived from a comprehensive literature review, interviews, and observations, and subjected to qualitative data analysis methods. The results show that fiqh practices in Aceh are always based on the fatwa of ulemas to provide legality of carrying out these practices.

Porous bearings are used extensively in wide range of equipment, including computers, office equipment, home appliances, electric motors, and vehicles. In light of the importance of the aforementioned applications, we explored how SR and porous materials affect annular discs under the condition of a squeeze film. A five-point Gauss quadrature integral formula has been used to examine the characteristics of annular discs and a small perturbation method has been used to discretise the governing Rabinowitsch fluid flow (RFF) equations. The impact of nonlinear parameters on the behaviour of porosity and SR have been visualised in terms of film pressure (FP), load carrying capacity (LCC), and squeeze response time (SRT) of annular discs. Under the conditions of pseudoplastic and dilatant fluids, the effects of SR and porous materials between annular discs have been estimated in the form of the film pressure, LCC, and SRT and are presented in this manuscript as tables and graphs. According to the findings, the performance of an annular disc is significantly affected by porous material and radial roughness patterns. In addition, when RFF is carried through a rough surface and porous media, the performance is found to improve for dilatant fluids but suffer for pseudoplastic fluids.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",34,2023

This temperature distribution is non-uniform on the outer tube due to continuous natural convection and radiation caused by the homogeneous steady-state heating of the inner tube, which represents the hot gas flow path through the turbine. The outer tube represents the case of a gas turbine. This temperature is important for the electronic components attached to the engine or the overall engine deformation. The presented approach allows for a quick estimation of the temperature distribution without the need to perform time consuming computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. This can greatly accelerate the design and development of gas turbines. A machine learning approach is applied to an extensive set of CFD simulations under different operating conditions and geometry setups.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",30,2023

The slag was activated with a 4M solution of sodium hydroxide. The behaviour of the internal structure of the paste was regularly monitored through the changes in the resonant frequency and the mechanical properties, until the paste reached the age of 90 days. The main aim of the article is to show the long-term maturation and degradation process of an AAS paste under different curing modes. The results obtained suggest that the curing mode of the specimens has a significant effect on the behaviour of the internal structure of the paste based on the AAS. The development of both the dynamic properties and the flexural strength indicates the occurrence of a higher porosity in the internal structure of the paste, especially when the free drying process is started earlier. Insufficient hydration of the binder system is also a likely cause of cracks. The reduction in the relative dynamic moduli values ranging from 50 % to 80 % was observed for drying specimens at the age of 90 days. What is very interesting is that the occurrence of cracks was not prevented even by intensive moist curing of the paste as, between the 21st and the 28th day of maturing, there was a significant decrease of about 20 % in the relative dynamic modulus of elasticity and also a 50 % reduction in the flexural strength.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",25,2023

The dictionary deserves our attention because it was undertaken by the author of a ground-breaking German dictionary (Adelung 1774-86, 21793-1801), working from Samuel Johnson's equally epoch-making English dictionary (1755, 41773). Yet the work has thus far been almost entirely overlooked. This article seeks to address that research gap. It reveals the very significant differences between the first dictionary volume (1783) and the second (1796), and argues that the second volume - for which a dictionary by Johannes Ebers is a major source (Ebers 1793-1794) - is almost certainly not the work of Adelung at all. Close analysis of the first volume nevertheless reveals the care that Adelung took with it, drawing not just on Johnson, but also on his own German dictionary and other sources, resulting in a dictionary that was innovative in English-German lexicography. I also show that Adelung's experience of preparing the English-German dictionary informed his revision of his better-known German dictionary (1793-1801) in at least two concrete ways: his treatment of pronunciation and his use of metalinguistic labelling.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",64,2023

To address this question, we examined keystroke latencies during the production of English compounds (e.g., snowball) to test whether the initiation and continued typing of each constituent (e.g., snow and ball) are influenced by its linguistic properties (length, frequency, and semantic transparency). Participants identified and then typed a compound word. We found that the initiation and continued typing of each constituent was influenced by the linguistic properties of that constituent. However, the linguistic properties of the second constituent also influenced the typing latency of the final letter of the first constituent, suggesting that production of the first constituent overlapped with accessing and planning the keystrokes of the second constituent.

His Polish nationality made it difcult for him to fnd a lecturer job in a Russian university, which was one of the reasons why he changed post rather frequently: Saint Petersburg, Kazan, Dorpat (now Tartu in Estonia), Cracow and Warsaw. To each assignment corresponded a change in his scientifc outlook, especially in phonetics and phonology. Today, Baudouin de Courtenay is remembered chiefy for his functional phonology elaborated in Kazan with his follower Mikołaj Kruszewski (who was also a Pole) from 1875 to 1883. This perspective, however, was not the only one entertained by Baudouin during his career. In this paper, three periods are highlighted: an initial phonetic phase (more or less in line with Neogrammarian doctrine), the “Kazan phonology”, and his fnal psychological conception. These periods are not neatly demarcated, so that views predominant in a period may linger on in a successive one. Each of these periods was, for a distinct batch of disciples, formative. They resulted in the creation of the Saint Petersburg phonological school, of which Ščerba was an important fgure, and the Warsaw school led by Baudouin’s former Polish students in Cracow. The Moscow Phonological School and the Prague School also reveal Baudouin’s infuence on their phonological conceptions. It is shown that the prominent role played by Baudouin in the feld of sound theory is best understood in the context of his changing views, which, to some extent, were at variance with each other.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",85,2023

Using an acoustic measure, a consonant-vowel intensity ratio, as an index of constriction of /ɡ/, we found that, similar to /b/ and /d/, the speaker's age, Spanish use, and sex have a strong impact on the realization of intervocalic /ɡ/. Specifically, younger speakers, those that speak Spanish most of the time, and men are likely to use less constricted variants such as approximants and elision.

Variables investigated included length and family size for both prefixes and roots, as well as number of allomorphs, consistency, and productivity for prefixes. Decision latencies were collected for 1,280 Malay words of various morphological structures. Data from the 640 prefixed words were analyzed in a series of GAMM models. We observed a facilitative effect of root family size and an effect of several distributional properties of prefixes on decision latencies after accounting for word frequency and length. Furthermore, a larger interaction between frequency and several distributional properties of prefixes was found for words with three-letter prefixes than for those with two-letter prefixes.

In this study, we test whether gestures help preschoolers access words for production. We tested two predictions generated from the LRH. First, since bilinguals often have greater difficulties with lexical access than monolinguals, we predicted that bilinguals will gesture more than monolinguals. Second, since low-frequency words are harder to access than high frequency words, we predicted that the more low-frequency words children used, the more they would gesture. Using children's (aged 4 to 6 years) data from a storytelling task, we found no difference in gesture use between bilinguals and monolinguals. We did, however, find that the use of low-frequency words was a positive predictor of gesture use.

All rights reserved.The current study examines the extent to which perceptual factors may account for the emergence of assibilated variants of the alveopalatal approximant /j/ in two geographically remote varieties of Spanish. Participants from Medellin, Colombia and Santiago, Dominican Republic completed a discrimination task and a matched guise. Both tasks presented listeners with stimuli containing affricate [ʤ] and approximant [j] allophones of /j/. Participants were more accurate when discriminating between sound pairs that included the affricate allophone, suggesting that the presence of (af )frication is a salient acoustic cue upon which judgments are reliably made. Therefore, we argue that the emergence of assibilated variants ([ʤ], [ʒ]) can be explained in part by more prominent acoustic cuing and thus greater perceptual salience. Evidence of the relationship between these findings and a possible sound change in progress is observed in the association of social characteristics with [ʤ] and [j].","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",48,2023

All rights reserved.In this article, we present some reflections on black Afroperspectivist epistemes and the relevance of aligning them to critical discursive studies in order to decolonize this field of knowledge. Initially, to understand what Afroperspectivist epistemes are, we discuss black embodied knowledge in order to understand its potential for decolonizing studies and how in the logic of modern science such knowledge has been made invisible. Later, we bring some guiding points of Noguera's afroperspective (2015,2019), seeking its interface with critical discursive studies. Furthermore, we briefly describe examples of discursive practices of resistance and re-existence as productions of knowledge by black people to illustrate the discursive materialization of embodied knowledge. To conclude, we point out that acting in the face of the cognitive injustice caused by coloniality is an extremely relevant path towards a decolonial practice as it ""goes beyond the processes that define knowledge relations, but which also rethink and give new meaning to the power structures that reduce, marginalize and make other practices and ways of feeling, seeing and interpreting the world invisible"" (Macedo, 2022).","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",31,2023

The author concludes that linguistic ideology has changed over time, from an explicit debt to the grammatical tradition to structuralist approaches, in which traditionalist postulates can still be observed. Furthermore, it is concluded that there are two tendencies when dealing with the synchronic, since there is a coexistence of the tendency to hierarchise linguistic varieties, which is linked to traditionalist linguistic ideology, and the tendency to describe languages technically, without establishing such hierarchies.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",59,2023

To do so, we apply a comparative CDA strategy to media treatment of alcohol (legal substance) and cannabis (illegal substance) consumption during 2016-2022, through a mixed methodological design focused on the prevailing topics and voices in the media coverage of each substance. Based on a 1244 news corpus from Clarín and La Voz del Interior, newspapers with the largest national and regional circulation respectively, with a dominant position in the local press market, we identified milestones in 2017 for cannabis, in 2018 for alcohol and in 2022 for both substances, related to an increase in news coverage around the context of regulatory changes although marked by significant discursive contradictions in its political-journalistic treatment. Thus, while cannabis was mostly treated in the “Police” section and with the security forces as the main source, alcohol was primarily covered in the “Citizens” section, taking policymakers and health professionals as frequent sources. Convergently, we observe ambiguity in the construction of alcohol and cannabis consumption as a social problem, alternating prohibitionist and harm reduction perspectives on cannabis, along with strict and permissive positions on alcohol.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",38,2023

This type of research is qualitative in the form of normative legal research using library research methods. Source data was taken through documentation. As for data analysis, it was used as thematic and inductive with a historical and philosophical approach. The research results concluded that the wali's right to ijbar, according to Imam Shafi'i is the father's right to force his daughter to marry or forbid her daughter from marrying a man as a form of protection and responsibility under certain conditions. Wali mujbir are divided into two groups: (a) for girls who are not yet adults, their father has the absolute right to ijbar without having to ask for his consent; (b) for adult girls who are 15 years old or have already had a period, although her father can marry her off without asking for her consent. There is a recommendation to consult with the girl, although this recommendation is optional. In the view of the maqasid sharia, the walis's ijbar aims to safeguard the interests of the girl child so that she can obtain an equal husband, maintain the religious quality of the girl and her future offspring, safeguard her welfare, safeguard her safety from potential abuse by her future husband, and maintain the good quality of offspring from a healthy husband, and complete with all five senses.

The data stem from a Finnish learner English corpus, comprising of 1,773 texts. The results of the study showed that while the lexical patterns of EDs in the data seemed to be mostly related to task type, some proficiency-related patterns of ED use were observed across all tasks. In some cases, proficiency-related patterns could also only be observed in some of the tasks, suggesting task type and proficiency are, to some extent, interrelated when examining the use of EDs. The results thus suggest that both task- and proficiency-related constraints of EDs should be considered in both foreign language teaching and assessment.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",47,2023

In these movies, dialogic interaction is often dominated by eloquent villains who skilfully flout the conversational maxims of Grice’s cooperative principle, thereby exercising verbal power over other interlocutors. As is demonstrated in a qualitative pragma-stylistic framework, the villains’ discursive strategies amount to stylistic deviation resulting in suspenseful implicatures.

In the current study, we tested whether subject orientation, a property that Japanese and Chinese reflexives share, affects the processing o f zibun. The results from an antecedent identification task show that L2 learners performed somewhat differently from native speakers, showing some preference for a non-subject NP, which is not an antecedent candidate for zibun. In a self-paced reading task, where two possible candidate antecedents could be considered for zibun, L2 learners took longer than native speakers to select an antecedent. We argue that L1-L2 sim ilarity does not guarantee target-like real-time comprehension o fzibun in Japanese.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",40,2023

We use a combination of methods, both corpus-based and qualitative in nature, to identify instances in which laughter occurs, which we (broadly) associate with the presence of humour. Thus, with the use of self-compiled corpora, we assess the nature of humorous mechanisms in the genre. We conclude by arguing that humorous encounters are genre-defining and essential for characterisation. Humour analysis allows us to argue that Chick Lit protagonists are prototypically presented as non-aggressive, non-threatening individuals, which also contributes to the depiction of down-to-earth characters readers expect in the genre.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",41,2023

All rights reserved.Among direct-developing rain frogs of the genus Craugastor is a clade of 19 described species (bocourti series) that occur in Mexico and northern Central America. Many of these 19 species have been described based on subtle morphological differences and have never been examined using molecular data. Here, we used a multilocus dataset (one mitochondrial (mtDNA) and four nuclear (nDNA) gene fragments, totalling 3,048 concatenated base pairs) to investigate species limits and phylogenetic relationships among 60 northern rain frogs referable to 12 species, with a focus on species from Guatemala. We inferred phylogenies using maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses on separate mtDNA and nDNA datasets. Concatenated and coalescent species-tree analyses support the monophyly of multiple species, with interspecific relationships mostly unresolved. These mtDNA and nDNA trees were often incongruent with morphology-based taxonomy. For example, two genetically shallow clades contained individuals referable to at least five described species, whereas a single described species contained deep divergences indicative of multiple cryptic species. These findings indicate that morphology-based taxonomy has both overestimated and underestimated actual species diversity (depending on the species), an interpretation supported by two molecular species-delimitation procedures. Based on these findings, we synonymise C. glaucus (Lynch, 1967) and C. stuarti (Lynch, 1967) with C. xucanebi (Stuart, 1941). We also synonymise C. nefrens (Smith, 2005) and C. cyanochthebius McCranie & Smith, 2006 with C. campbelli (Smith, 2005). The molecular data also support multiple undescribed species, notably within C. decoratus (Taylor, 1942).

To rapidly and accurately predict the pigment content of tomato leaves, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, chlorophyll and carotenoid were extracted from the leaves of tomato seedlings cultured at different nitrogen concentrations. The visible/near-infrared hyperspectral imaging non-destructive measurement technology, 430-900 nm and 950-1650 nm, with total variables of 794, was used to obtain the reflection spectra of leaves. An improved strategy of the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) based on logistic chaotic mapping was proposed, and it optimized the back propagation neural network to predict the pigment content of leaves. Different pretreatment methods were used to effectively improve the prediction accuracy of the model. The results showed that when the nitrogen concentration in the nutrient solution was 302.84 mg·L-1, the pigment content of the leaves reached its maximum. Meanwhile, the inhibition effect of high concentrations was much stronger than that of low concentrations. To address the problem that the SSA is prone to premature convergence due to the reduction of population diversity at the end of the iteration, the initialization of the SSA population by logistic chaotic mapping improves the initial solution quality, convergence speed, and search capacity. The root mean squared error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2) and relative percent deviation (RPD) of chlorophyll a were 0.77, 0.77, and 2.08, respectively.

The RMSE, R2 and RPD of carotenoid were 0.14, 0.75, and 2.00, respectively. Hyperspectral imaging technology combined with machine learning algorithms can achieve rapid and accurate prediction of crop physiological information, providing data support for the precise management of fertilization in facility agriculture, which is conducive to improving the quality and output of tomatoes.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",25,2023

All rights reserved.A bioretanning agent was developed as an alternative to conventional synthetic retanning agents to pave the way for sustainability in the leather industry. Solid chromium shaving wastes from leather processing produced a proteinic sub-structure for the constitution building block of the bioretanning agent's backbone. The alkaline hydrolysis method was used to obtain the protein hydrolyzate, and the residual chromium content was determined as <80 ppm. The protein hydrolyzates were acquired in different molecular weights, and the hybrid biopolymers were obtained by grafting the hydrolyzates with acrylic acids (AAc) and acrylamides (AAm). To evaluate the properties imparted by the designed bioretanning agent, it was incorporated into the leather in the retanning processes and compared to the control samples fabricated with conventional procedures. As a result, penetration of hybrid biopolymer into the matrix for retanning was achieved easily, and using low and high molecular weight biopolymers have been recorded by 20% and 23% of improvement in the mechanical performance of the leather samples, respectively. Furthermore, the ratio of the hydrolyzate and AAm/AAc was found to be fitted at 1:2 for both. Furthermore, as per the evaluation of the leathers retanned by novel biopolymer, the results were promising in terms of technical viability and revealed that the biopolymer usage could enhance the mechanical performance of the leather while benefiting from the waste-to-wealth approach.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",26,2023

The yarns (Ne20) in different slub thickness (1.2, 1.4, 1.6 and 1.8), slub length (1 – 3, 5 – 7 and 10 – 12 cm.), slub frequency (0.5, 3 and 6 pcs/m) and slub ramp length (1, 2 and 4 cm.) were produced from PET fibers. The multipopulation slub yarn, which has two-slub length, was also spun. The measurements of the yarns were made on the Fancy Yarn Profile of the Uster Tester 5 and the Uster Tensojet devices. The values of the test result were analyzed and evaluated statically. The slub parameters were found to have a significant effect on the unevenness and strength properties of the yarns. As the slub thickness, slub length and frequency increased, the yarn unevenness, hairiness increased and the yarn strength decreased. Medium ramp length was found suitable for higher breaking strength and elongation of the slub yarns and it was determined that the number of population was found statistically significant for these properties.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",21,2023

Sprawozdania Archeologiczne 75/2, 137-186. Amber was one of the key raw materials distributed in Bronze Age Europe. One of its varieties – succinite – was exchanged over a vast area stretching from its sources on the southern shores of the Baltic Sea to the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. The chemical identification of Baltic amber significantly expands our knowledge of the dynamics and nature of the relationships connecting different regions of Europe in the first half of the second millennium BC. One of the most significant cultural-geographical areas reached by this amber was the Carpathian Basin. This text presents a summary of the current state of knowledge about the context, chronology, and the extent of amber occurrence in the Hungarian Bronze Age. At the same time, it supplements the catalogue of finds with artefacts acquired in recent years, providing new information regarding radiocarbon dating and spectral analysis of selected amber artifacts.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",154,2023

Then, the test image was transferred to fabric using the sublimation printing process. The ink jet printer was installed with dye sublimation ink. Color strength, CIELab color coordinate, color difference ΔE* and GLCM (grey level co-occurrence matrix) image processing method were used to analyze the print quality. The significant change in print quality was caused by the sublimation transfer paper, resulting in a medium color difference noticeable to the human eye, while the significant change in print quality was not caused by the total ink limiting level of dye sublimation ink for printing sublimation transfer paper. The print with the maximum color strength was obtained with the 270 % total ink limiting level of dye sublimation ink. The color difference between prints obtained with lighter sublimation transfer paper with a higher transfer rate printed with 100 % and 270 % total ink limiting levels of dye sublimation ink was less than 1, suggesting a color difference undetectable to the human eye. Considering the importance of ink in terms of costs in businesses, the optimal total ink limiting level of dye sublimation ink for printing sublimation transfer paper and achieving good print quality was 100 %. The total ink limiting level of dye sublimation ink for printing sublimation transfer paper is useful for saving money on ink, so good print quality will be reached at a lower total ink limiting level.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",27,2023

All rights reserved.Globalisation is a deep-rooted phenomenon that has significantly shaped developed and developing economies alike. Characterised by its controversial past, South Africa provides a unique case when considering how global integration has affected the country’s economy. Among the more intriguing relationships has been the interlinkage between the country’s public debt levels and the manner in which it has globalised. On one hand, advocates suggest that economic integration has enabled the government to provide greater social assistance in the hope of rectifying its controversial past. On the other hand, however, globalisation is believed to increase pressure on the fiscal budget with increased levels of debt needed to mitigate the pressure of external shocks. The primary objective of this study was to analyse the relationship between public debt and economic globalisation in South Africa. It followed a quantitative research approach using secondary time-series data from 1980 to 2020. Long-run relationships were evaluated through the use of a Bayer–Hanck combined cointegration test, while FMOLS, DOLS and CCR estimation techniques were employed to estimate elasticity relationships. The results corroborate the existence of a positive relationship between higher levels of economic globalisation and public debt. Moreover, the causality results revealed a unidirectional causal link between these variables emanating from the economic integration of the country. This implies significant consequences for fiscal policymakers towards balancing its role as a crucial macroeconomic role player. The findings in fact point to noteworthy implications surrounding the restricting effects of the integration process, pertaining to higher borrowing costs, increased external vulnerability and limited fiscal capability in the context of improving the country’s social environment.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",99,2023

This study investigated the effect of one of the parameters that affect the corrosion process, the stirring rate, on the behavior of Steel 37 in 0.1 N of sulfuric acid. The main method used in this study is an electrochemical method (using a potentiostat at a scan rate of 3 MV.sec-1), applied at three different temperatures (25, 30, and ˚C). To evaluate the parameters of corrosion in this study, the Tafel extrapolation method was used. At a constant stirring rate, the corrosion current density was found to be increased with increasing temperature at a constant stirring rate. In addition, the corrosion rate increased with increasing stirring rate at a constant temperature due to the rise of the diffusion coefficient of oxygen. The Levich equation was used to calculate the limiting current densities, as well as the mass transfer coefficient (Km) and the Sherwood number (Sh). The Km values were calculated and it was found that the mass transfer coefficient was greater at higher temperatures and stirring rates. The results also revealed that the smallest values of Sh (2.575, 3.897) occurred at 30 °C at two stirring rates (200 and 400 rpm).","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",31,2023

All rights reserved.As it is known, the modern agricultural tractor is no longer just a machine capable of pulling agricultural trailers and operating implements but has evolved into a multi-purpose and mobile energy source with standardized interfaces (mechanical, hydraulic, and electronic) to connect to several typologies of agricultural operating machines. It follows that the selection of the most appropriate tractors for the specific production realities is a crucial aspect for farmers, advisors, contractors, and farm machinery experts. The tractors choice thus must consider different parameters, concerning not only the cost of the machines but also their dimensions, power, weight, technological level, etc. The availability of simplified models for estimating the purchase investment and sizing the machine in relation to its mechanical characteristics could be a useful tool in making the choice of tractor more suitable for the specific agricultural context. This study aimed to collect and analyze the technical parameters of tractors present on the Italian market (more than 1300 models), divided into: i) four wheel-drive (4WD) standard tractors; ii) two wheel-drive standard tractors; iii) narrow track 4WD tractors; iv) isodiametric specialized 4WD tractors; v) crawler tractors; and vi) rubber-tracked tractors. This allows for the definition of the most relevant parameterto- parameter and parameter-to-price relations for updating reference models to calculate the machine price and the weight to engine power ratio. Other relations, including the 3-point hitch efficiency with respect to the tractors weight and the relationship between the rated engine power and its displacement, are proposed to provide synthetic tools to characterize and compare, from a mechanical point of view, the different categories of agricultural tractors.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",36,2023

Consequently, it is crucial for these providers to cultivate a positive image, as it can lead to customer loyalty and positive recommendations. However, to date, no research has been conducted to assess how the marketing activities of electricity providers within the marketing mix affect their image. Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine how marketing actions undertaken within the marketing mix by electricity providers influence their image. Referring to the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) theory, research hypotheses were formulated, and a regression model was constructed, assuming the positive impacts of selected marketing actions of electricity providers on their image. A quantitative approach was employed to test the research hypotheses. Data were collected through a questionnaire survey of 503 randomly selected domestic electricity consumers, and statistical analysis was used for the purposes of data analysis. The research results indicate that the following marketing activities of electricity providers have a positive impact on their image: offering other products along with electricity, providing price discounts, providing physical customer service offices, and engagement in sponsorship. Several positive effects of marketing activities of electricity providers on their image were identified. Thus, the study theoretically contributes to the field of marketing management of energy companies. Based on the results obtained, the following practical implications for electricity providers can be proposed. It is recommended that these providers employ the following marketing activities to shape a positive image among consumers: offering other products along with electricity, providing price discounts, providing physical customer service offices, and engaging in sponsorship.

Said impact varied, with some countries maintaining or boosting their investment attractiveness, while others suffered drastically. Understanding these dynamics is vital due to the key role of investment in economic growth, job creation, and competitiveness. The literature review highlights gaps in understanding the pandemic's impact on investment in Central and Eastern Europe. These gaps include limited analysis of sector-specific investment market transformations, the inadequate assessment of the pandemic's influence on investment behaviours, and insufficient research on effective measures to enhance investment activity. This study aims to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on investment attractiveness and enterprise activities in Central and Eastern European countries. Utilising methods such as dialectical scientific cognition, system and statistical analysis, and regression analysis (examining the relationship between FDI and GDP), the research uncovers imbalances in investment activity due to the pandemic. It identifies a direct correlation between GDP and investment volumes and examines sectoral disproportions and national/regional investment peculiarities. The study delves into the pandemic-induced shift in investor orientation and caution, as well as the effects of subsequent COVID-19 waves and macroeconomic policies on investment and economic growth. It addresses how the pandemic exacerbated income inequality and social tensions, influencing investment stability and decisions. In conclusion, the pandemic prompted cautious investment behaviour and a partial investor reorientation.

With over 2.6 million scientific articles published each year, the turnover of scientific journals exceeds $25 billion annually. Five publishers share nearly half of this lucrative market. Scientists are the key players in the process, but other stakeholders have gradually been introduced, building various business models whose similarities and differences are described here. Concepts underlying scientific publication: Open access to scientific papers dates back to the scientific and technical revolution of the 17th century. However, its evolution has been considerably boosted by the development of the Internet and the recognition of science as ""commons"".Scientific integrity is under the control of research institutions to ensure the prevention of fraud and misconduct in the course of scientific production. Usually, the scientific integrity is questioned during the manuscript reviewing process which may result in identification of flaws. Models of scientific publications: In the historical model, readers pay for access to the document. Authors are not remunerated and renounce copyright on their articles to the publisher. The limits of the historical model became clear in the 90s, facing the cost of publishing, reduction in the number of subscribers, development of the Internet and willingness to improve manuscript evaluation.With the development of the Internet and the paradigm of open access, publishers proposed a new model in the 2000s, replacing the cost of access to articles for the reader with the payment of Article Processing Charges (APCs) paid by the author or its institution (""author pays"" model). In this model, the content of the article can be freely reproduced and used, provided that the original author is credited. In addition to the evaluation of the manuscript which remains a critical factor, the cost of publication appears inequitable. However, all or part of the APCs may be waived, particularly for authors from low- and middle-income countries.For the past 15 years or so, publishers, learned societies and academic or research institutions (including libraries) have been seeking to publish reliable, open access manuscripts that respect scientific integrity while being affordable for the author.Predatory journals emerged in the late 2000s, taking advantage of the success of the authorpays model to capture APCs. Lacking a proper evaluation process resulting in poor-quality publications, these journals are rejected by most scientific institutions. On the other hand, they are particularly attractive in low- and middle-income countries because of their aggressive commercial practices (insistent invitation to submit a manuscript, low rejection rate, rapid publication, reduced APC, etc.).The purpose of each journal is to secure its economic model. This goes through ensuring its visibility, which is determined by the number of citations (online and social media citations) rather than the quality of the articles published. Peer review: This very old concept has not been widely used until the 20th century. In the historical model, manuscript evaluation is generally carried out by members of the learned society that publishes the journal. Evaluation can be either unblinded, single-blinded (referee is anonymous) or double-blinded (author and referee are anonymous). Several studies have shown that blind procedures do not alter the quality of the evaluation. Since the early 90s, post-publication evaluation has emerged, of which there are several variants. The aim is to shorten times to publication and open up the evaluation process more widely in order to limit the bias. Apart from the fact that this system does not guarantee a better evaluation of the manuscript, its main disadvantage is that the article is accessible without validation of the data collection and analysis throughout the entire process, which can be lengthy. Cost and funding of scientific journals: The cost of an article depends on charges that vary according to the conditions and places of production. Reviewers are volunteers. On the other hand, manuscript management, editing and distribution are carried out by professionals, which entail financial charges. Some of these costs are lower in low- and medium-resource countries, where economies of scale and higher benefits are possible. Conclusion: The limits of the historical model have led to the development of several business models of scientific journals, that are in constant evolution, especially the author pays model which promises open access to publications but impacts scientific production. However, the evaluation of scientific production is heterogeneous due to a limited pool of reviewers inadequately selected. Scientific publishing is looking for solutions to find a virtuous model that respects open science, open access to data and scientific integrity. The ""Diamond open access"" model, free of charge for both readers and authors with the guarantee of an irrevocable license to reproduce the content of the article provided that the original source is cited, perfectly fits.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",null,2023

It is an opportunistic pathology, very common in HIV-immunocompromised persons, classifying it at the WHO stage 4. Ear tuberculosis remains a rare and under-diagnosed clinical form. We report here a case of ear tuberculosis concomitant with pulmonary localization in an HIV-immunosuppressed person on triple antiretroviral therapy aged 32 years hospitalized in Bamako (Mali) to discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties posed by this rare localization. Description of the case: The patient had a chronic productive cough, otalgia and right chronic purulent otorrhea. The search for acid-resistant bacilli was positive for direct examination in gastric casing fluid and swabbing of the ear pus, confirming the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Anti-tuberculosis treatment instituted for 6 months associated with adjuvants resulted in complete healing of the patient. Discussion/conclusion: Although rare, ear localization must be actively sought. Etiological treatment must be instituted upon confirmation of the diagnosis to avoid complications and sequelae.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",null,2023

A strategy for strengthening social science skills in Africa,Medecine tropicale et sante internationale,"[('Recherches Translationnelles sur le VIH et les Maladies Infectieuses', 'Montpellier', 'France')]","Copyright © 2023 SFMTSI.The Covid pandemic was a reminder of the need to be prepared for epidemics and pandemics and to take into account their socio-political dimensions by developing socioanthropological and interdisciplinary approaches. In the post-crisis era, the challenge is one of operationality. How can these dimensions be made more visible? How can we develop analyses that can help to humanize institutional responses, make inequalities visible to limit them during the crisis, reveal structural determinants of transmission, and define interventions that are scientifically sound, ethically just and respectful of diversity?Three strategies are relevant to meet these challenges: (1) more social scientists in Frenchspeaking Africa must get expertise on epidemics to investigate associated issues before, during and after epidemic crisis; (2) public health professionals, health and social workers must get informed about social, historical, economic and political aspects of epidemics that shape risk, care and control; (3) collaborations between researchers and those involved in responding to epidemics on the basis of shared knowledge must develop.This article presents a capacity-building initiative developed in French-speaking West Africa by the Anthropology of Emerging Epidemics Network (RAAE), in conjunction with other networks (Sonar-Global) and institutions (CRCF, IRD). It describes and analyzes a program that combines a working method, a scientific content and teaching tools. This program benefited from previous training experiences and gathered expertise from about 25 social scientists, mainly medical anthropologists, who have worked on various epidemics and pandemics such as AIDS, Ebola, plague, Covid and dengue in West Africa and beyond. The process to develop the course was based on workshops followed by redaction periods, then testings for content and tools during training sessions.The course focuses on two audiences: social science researchers (with a Master degree level and above) and social and health workers (public health, community health, NGOs, social workers). For the former, the course aims at reinforcing theoretical and methodological skills through the presentation of issues, key concepts, selected theoretical developments, themes and bibliographical references. For the latter, the course is based on modules about operational issues that can be taken separately, to better adapt the content of trainings to local teams' needs. For both, a glossary includes 100 definitions of public health, medical and social science vocabulary, relevant to epidemics. The content in terms of skills to be acquired (knowledge, know-how) is presented briefly in the article. Both the scientific content and learning methods and tools are presented in a manual (Desclaux et al., Anthropologie appliquée aux épidémies émergentes, 2022 [5]) as well as on Sonar-Global (English) and RAEE (French) websites (www.sonar-global.eu, www.raee.fr).The knowledge to be imparted is organized into 13 modules: introduction; the framework for responding to epidemics; emergence and One Health; antimicrobial resistance; infectious risk (inequalities, stigmatization and prevention); knowledge (circulation and interpretation); health services (places of risk and care); public health measures (lockdown and distancing); experiences (suffering of the sick and mobilization); death (meaning and rituals); vaccination (innovation, equity and hesitation); epidemic cycles (preparation, response and recovery); challenges, methods, ethics and governance; and conclusion.The first training courses held in Senegal and Burkina Faso for university researchers and young scholars from Africa and France were positively evaluated by the participants. They report that they have acquired knowledge in epidemic social science, but also in public health, which has given them the necessary basis for communicating and developing collaborations (in research and intervention) with social and health actors. The model could be duplicated with adaptation for new training sessions organized by other institutions, for which a manual is available.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",null,2023

Methods: We conducted a retrospective and descriptive study based on the records of patients followed for Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) between January 1, 2014 and June 30, 2018 at the resistant tuberculosis management unit in Maradi (Niger). This unit is located within the RHC of Maradi and has a capacity of 20 beds in 4 wards. It receives patients with tuberculosis resistant to first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. In this study, patients diagnosed with RR-TB by genotypic (GeneXpert MTB/RIF) or phenotypic (culture) testing were included. We excluded from this study: patients previously treated for more than 1 month with second-line anti-TB drugs; patients with resistance to second-line injectables (SLI) and/or fluoroquinolones (FQ); patients with an electrocardiogram QTc greater than 500 ms (the corrected QT (QTc) estimates the QT interval at a rate of 60 beats per second); cases of atypical mycobacteriosis detected by phenotypic testing.Patients were previously on 2RHZE/4RH prior to the discovery of resistance. The treatment protocol for resistant TB was as follows: 4KmMfxPtoCfzHZE/5MfxCfzZE (The second-line injectable was replaced by Lzd in case of initial or treatment-emergent deafness). HIV co-infected patients received, in addition to anti-tuberculosis drugs, antiretrovirals and cotrimoxazole in preventive doses. Results: A total of 80 patients were included in the present study (70 males and 10 females, mean age 34.4 years with extremes ranging from 18 to 71 years). Patients aged 18-35 years accounted for more than half. Patients with primary treatment failure were the most frequent type (36%) followed by patients with retreatment failure (24%) and patients with retreatment relapse (17%). It should be noted that 77 patients (96%) were previously treated for TB and only 3 patients (4%) were new cases. The majority of patients (70%) had a Body mass index of less than 18 kg/m2. 7.5% of patients were HIV positive, one was diabetic, 52% of the patients had grade 2 radiological lesions. Grade 1 deafness was noted at the beginning of treatment in 3%. A third of patients (36%) were primary treatment failures. The treatment protocol was as follows: 4KmMfxPtoCfzHZE/5MfxCfzZE. Only 1 patient had a positive culture at the end of the 4th month of treatment. Most of the patients had experienced adverse events, mainly digestive, with vomiting being the most common. The therapeutic success rate was 88%. We noted 10% of deaths, 1% of therapeutic failure and 1% of lost to follow-up.Six months after treatment, 48 patients (60%) were smear negative and 43 (54%) were culture negative. In 32 patients (40%), the smear was not performed and culture was not performed in 37. Conclusion: The short treatment regime gives satisfactory results in the absence of resistance to fluoroquinolones, with rare adverse effects. In Niger, further efforts should be made to minimize the delay in diagnosis which is responsible for most deaths during treatment. A centre could usefully be designated to organize ""TB consiliums"" allowing any practitioner to submit difficult cases of MDR-TB.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",null,2023

The disease, caused by bacterium Bordetella pertussis, is present in all countries. Before vaccines became widely available in the 1950s, pertussis was one of the most common childhood diseases worldwide. According to WHO, estimation of deaths was 4 millions/year in 1950 and 100 000/year in 2015. But morbidity remains important with a high circulation of the bacterium determining atypical clinical forms after whole cell or acellular vaccines use. This is due mainly to the absence of booster doses in adolescents and adults. Major progress are generalisation of PCR and vaccination of mother during pregnancy. A resurgence of pertussis is observed after generalisation of acellular vaccines use. In China the progression of allele ptxPl was found in all areas following the use of acellular vaccine. This allele, rare before acellullar vaccine, is linked to a macrolide resistance, and reaches more than 30% of strains isolated in hospitalised children.These evolutions must be evaluated in clinical forms and genotyping of all strains, in all areas.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2023', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2023'}, 'day': '31'}",null,2023

All rights reserved.Introduction: Uterine fibroids are a prevalent and benign tumor in the uterine wall that commonly affects women of reproductive age. These growths can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes. This study aims to investigate the crucial role of myometrial stem cells in the development of fibroids and their impact on pregnancy complications. Methods: The following terms were used in the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, ScienceDirect and MEDLINE databases to search for articles in English: Uterine Fibroids, Myometrial stem cells, Pregnancy complications, and Hormones. The articles selected were systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and reviews. These data were searched from 2016 to May 2023. Results: The study found that myometrial stem cells differentiated into smooth muscle cells, contributing to fibroid development. These fibroid stem cells had distinct hormone receptor characteristics. Hormonal imbalances and genetic predisposition led to the uncontrolled growth of myocytes, which played a central role in the formation of fibroids. Estrogen and progesterone, which support uterine tissue growth, were identified as key factors in this process. In addition, ECM remodeling, angiogenesis, inflammation, and dysregulated signaling pathways were shown to be implicated in fibroid development. Conclusion: Uterine fibroids have a significant impact on pregnancy outcomes, leading to various complications such as preterm birth, cesarean delivery, placental abnormalities, and heavy bleeding. The severity of these complications depends on factors like fibroid size, location, and individual factors. Therefore, understanding the complex interplay of factors, including the involvement of myometrial stem cells, hormonal influence, inflammation, and ECM changes, is crucial for improving patient care. The knowledge gained from this study has the potential to inform targeted therapies and interventions for women with fibroids during pregnancy, ultimately improving the health of both mother and baby. However, further research is needed to elucidate precise mechanisms and develop more effective treatments for managing pregnancies complicated by fibroids.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2024'}, 'day': '31'}",57,2024

All rights reserved.Introduction: Treatment of malocclusion with fixed orthodontic appliances can create some stagnations that harbour plaque with concomitant obstruction to conventional oral hygiene procedures. Objectives: The purpose of the present study was to assess oral hygiene status, and determine its effect on treatment duration and orthodontic appliance failure among adolescent and young orthodontic clients treated at Smile Dental Clinic. Methods: A retrospective study covering the period between 2019 and 2022 was conducted at Smile Dental Clinic. A total of 176 dental records of adolescent and young orthodontic clients aged 10 to 24 years were accessed to collect information on oral hygiene status, number of dental visits, missed scheduled appointments, socio-demographics and status of brackets and molar tube breakages. Results: A high proportion of female (71.4%) and young orthodontic clients aged 20 – 24 years (50.6%) had good oral hygiene. A significantly high proportion of clients in boarding schools (67.8%) and those who frequently missed scheduled appointments (91.9%) had poor oral hygiene status. Treatment duration was longer for clients with poor oral hygiene (30.5 months versus 26.8 months) but those with good oral hygiene made significantly fewer numbers of dental visits (8 versus 10). Clients with poor oral hygiene were 9 and 14 times more likely to experience broken molar tubes and broken brackets respectively. Conclusion: Oral hygiene of adolescent and young orthodontic clients treated is sub-optimal and affects the rate of orthodontic appliance failure and duration of fixed orthodontic treatment duration. Increased exposure to oral hygiene messages through frequent dental visits may help to motivate clients to maintain good oral hygiene.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2024'}, 'day': '31'}",41,2024

All rights reserved.Background: The World Health Organization defines postnatal care when it is given to the mother and her newborn baby immediately after the birth of the placenta and for the first six weeks of life. The majority of maternal and neonatal deaths occur during childbirth and the postpartum period which can be prevented through adequate utilization of antenatal and postnatal care services. Objective: To assess obstetric factors associated with the uptake of postnatal care services among mothers who gave birth in the last six months in Dodoma region, Tanzania Method: This community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 420 study participants from January to March 2021. Logistic regression analysis was carried out to measure obstetric factors associated with the uptake of postnatal care. An adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval and p-value less than 0.05 was applied. Results: The uptake of the recommended four postnatal care visits was 136 (32%). Mothers who received counselling during ANC were almost 4 times more likely to utilize adequate PNC services than their counterparts (AOR=3.737; 95%CI =1.176-31.882; P=0.025). Those who delivered by C/Section were almost 12 times more likely to utilize PNC services adequately (AOR=11.913; 95%CI =3.0901-45.933; P=0.000). Awareness of the PNC schedule was 18 times more likely to use the PNC services adequately compared with their counterparts (AOR=18.092; 95%CI =8.239-39.726; P=0.000). Awareness of maternal danger signs was almost 5 times more likely to utilize PNC service adequately than their counterparts (AOR=4.691; 95%CI =2.168-10.153; P=0.000). Conclusion: The overall uptake of adequate postnatal care in the study area was low. Obstetric factors were found as strong predictors of adequate PNC service uptake among study participants. There is a need to strengthen routine health education during the antenatal and postpartum periods to enhance adequate PNC services uptake among women.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2024'}, 'day': '31'}",29,2024

All rights reserved.The purpose of this study is to determine the level of employee satisfaction with the performance of tasks assigned by the employer in remote form, to explore the discrepancy between employee expectations and the experience of remote working and to identify the characteristics shaping employee preferences, together with an attempt to identify and classify the requirements of IT staff carrying out their professional duties remotely. Employee job satisfaction is a source of benefits both for the employees themselves and for companies operating in a dynamically changing environment. The issue of remote working is the subject of public debate and is a particularly current and important research topic. Satisfaction with remote working is a multidimensional phenomenon encompassing different aspects of the work experience, as well as a subjective experience that varies from person to person, considered in relation to a variety of factors. The paper is theoretical and methodological in nature, using a variety of research methods and techniques, such as a survey questionnaire, the Kano model and the Servqual approach. These methods were supported by a classical literature review, which served as a supporting tool and starting point for further analysis and critique of the literature, as well as structural and causal analysis. The primary data collected through the survey questionnaire were analysed and inferred, and the results showed that IT employees' expectations of remote working are not fully met, especially in the areas of career development and adaptation. Significant differences relate to bonuses, recognition and job stability. The largest unfulfilled expectations are related to job stability, bonuses, allowances to cover the costs of remote working and workplace flexibility. Remote working has positive aspects such as less environmental stress, higher productivity, reduced costs and commuting- related stress. Most of the identified features of remote working (20 out of 24) directly influence job satisfaction. Access to global projects attracts potential employees the most. Three features - subsidised equipment, coverage of remote working costs, and the environmental impact of remote working - are irrelevant to employee satisfaction. This study addresses a topical and relevant contemporary issue in the field of remote working and job satisfaction. It is a pioneering study focusing on the links between remote working and IT employee satisfaction. To date, research has considered the issue from the perspective of remote working, the IT sector or job satisfaction in relation to various factors. However, there is a lack of research combining these three issues. Furthermore, analysis based on the Servqual method and the Kano model has so far been used to measure service quality in various industries and to analyse and categorise customer needs in relation to satisfaction. The application of this tool to the study of employee satisfaction with remote working in the IT industry is a new and unique approach. The findings may be relevant to employers, IT employees, HR professionals and regulators alike.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2024'}, 'day': '31'}",100,2024

This study was designed to probe the role of tumor-derived exosomal miR-1247-3p in mediating the angiogenesis in bladder cancer. Exosomes isolation from the culture medium of normal or bladder cancer cell lines was performed using a differential centrifugation method. miR-1247-3p expression in exosomes and cells was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The effect of exosomes on the angiogenesis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was assessed using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), transwell and tube formation assays. The interaction between miR-1247-3p and forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) was studied using luciferase reporter and RNA pull down assays. Exosomes were successfully isolated from T24, UM-UC-3, and SV-HUC-1 cells, as confirmed by corresponding identifications. Functional experiments revealed that exosomes derived from T24 and UM-UC-3 cells significantly enhanced the abilities of proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and vascular endothelial-derived growth factor (VEGF) secretion in HUVECs. miR-1247-3p was highly expressed in exosomes derived from T24 and UM-UC-3 cells, and exosomes derived from miR-1247-3p inhibitor-transfected cells reduced HUVEC viability, migration, tube formation, and VEGF level. FOXO1 was confirmed as a direct target of miR-1247-3p. Rescue assays suggested that the effect of miR-1247-3p inhibition on the viability, migration, and angiogenesis of HUVECs was partly abrogated by the knockdown of FOXO1. Our data suggest that miR-1247-3p is up-regulated in tumor-derived exosomes, thereby inhibiting FOXO1 expression and facilitating angiogenesis in bladder cancer.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2024'}, 'day': '31'}",null,2024

Metabolic reprogramming, a defining characteristic of cancer, has emerged as a promising target for novel therapies. SLC7A11, an amino acid transporter that facilitates cysteine uptake in exchange for glutamate, plays a crucial role in sustaining the altered metabolism of cancer cells. This study delves into the comprehensive analysis of SLC7A11 at the genomic, transcriptomic, and protein levels in extensive BC datasets to elucidate its potential role in different BC subtypes. SLC7A11 gene copy number and mRNA expression were evaluated using the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) cohort (n = 1,980) and Breast Cancer Gene Expression Miner (n = 4,712). SLC7A11 protein was assessed using immunohistochemistry in a large BC cohort (n = 1,981). Additionally, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset was used to explore SLC7A11 DNA methylation patterns using MethSurv (n = 782) and association of SLC7A11 mRNA expression with immune infiltrates using TIMER (n = 1,100). High SLC7A11 mRNA and SLC7A11 protein expression were significantly associated with high tumor grade (p ≤ .02), indicating a potential role in cancer progression. Interestingly, SLC7A11 copy number gain was observed in HER2+ tumors (p = .01), suggesting a subtype-specific association. In contrast, SLC7A11 mRNA expression was higher in the basal-like/triple-negative (TN; p < .001) and luminal B tumors (p = .02), highlighting its differential expression across BC subtypes. Notably, high SLC7A11 protein expression was predominantly observed in Estrogen Receptor (ER)-negative and Triple Negative (TN) BC, suggesting a role in these aggressive subtypes. Further analysis revealed that SLC7A11 was positively correlated with other amino acid transporters and enzymes associated with glutamine metabolism, implying a coordinated role in metabolic regulation. Additionally, SLC7A11 gene expression was positively associated with neutrophil and macrophage infiltration, suggesting a potential link between SLC7A11 and tumor immunity. Our findings suggest that SLC7A11 plays a significant role in BC metabolism, demonstrating differential expression across subtypes and associations with poor patient outcomes. Further functional studies are warranted to elucidate the precise mechanisms by which SLC7A11 contributes to BC progression and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '31 December 2024'}, 'day': '31'}",null,2024

Examining Australia’s Allegiance toward the USA-Led “War on Terror” and Its Implications for Regional Engagement under the Liberal–National Coalition of John Howard,International Journal of Interdisciplinary Global Studies,"[('Tripura University', 'Agartala', 'India')]","© 2024 Common Ground Research Networks. All rights reserved.A major aspect of Australia’s foreign policy is balancing its alliance with the USA and its regional engagement diplomacy. While both are significant foreign policy agendas, they have often been an issue of contestation. In no period was this contestation more glaring than under the Liberal–National coalition government of John Howard, which ignited debates on Australia’s Western identity located in an Asian neighborhood. The coalition under Howard repeatedly claimed that both these foreign policy objectives are not zero-sum games, in a popular phrase that the country does not face a choice between its “history” and “geography.” This article disputes this claim by analyzing the Southeast Asian states’ response to Australia’s allegiance to the US-led “War on Terror.” Instead, by highlighting the friction between Australia’s reinvigoration of the US alliance and pursuit of regional engagement, the article underscores the dilemma the coalition had to encounter in adhering to the US strategic objectives, such as preemption and military intervention, and in implementing the same in the region. The article also places the contradictions in the larger context of competing visions of regionalism as adhered to by Australia and the Southeast Asian states. The article argues that while there was practical cooperation between Australia and Southeast Asia under Howard, his tenure was also testimony to the fact that this cooperation does not necessarily lead to a genuine harmony between Australia’s “history” and “geography” and that narrowing down the divide depends on the country’s accommodation toward regional norms and sentiments.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '30 December 2024'}, 'day': '30'}",79,2024

All rights reserved.Background: The COVID-19 pandemic caused dramatic disruptions in the education of pharmacy students who graduated in 2022. As an additional active learning opportunity at a New York City hospital site with multiple preceptors and faculty, a monthly student-led virtual educational conference was implemented. The objective of this study was to assess student perspectives on the implementation of a virtual peer education conference. Methods: Between May 2021 and May 2022, a total of twenty-eight students participated as presenters or attendees. All students completed a 13-item survey to evaluate the impact their participation in the virtual conference had on their overall learning and how similar opportunities could impact their future learning experiences. Results: When asked to rate on a scale from 1 (did NOT improve at all) to 5 (greatly improved my learning), 93% (26/28) of students rated their change in learning after attending the student-led conference as a four or five. Students identified that participation enhanced their drug/disease state knowledge, improved their presentation skills and/or improved their critical thinking and clinical application skills. Conclusion: In the future, advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) can consider the inclusion of peer education through an online platform as a strategy to facilitate learning in pharmacy programmes.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '30 December 2024'}, 'day': '30'}",12,2024

Several neuropeptides act as immune system regulators, which nerve terminals release as co-transmitters. It has been suggested that Neuropeptide Y (NPY) may be involved in inflammatory diseases through its ability to regulate the function of inflammatory cells. Consequently, the present study was designed to examine the changes in this neuropeptide in the serum of patients with Covid-19 disease, particularly following anti-inflammatory treatment, and its relationship with other inflammatory factors such as TNF-α. METHODS: The demographic information, vital and clinical signs (blood oxygen saturation level, blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature), laboratory factors such as blood factors, inflammation, and blood electrolytes, as well as the use of steroids, were collected before and after steroid treatment the patient files. As part of the study, serum samples from patients were used to measure levels of NPY and TNF-α inflammatory factors using an ELISA kit. Additionally, the correlation between NPY values, other inflammatory factors, and other variables was examined before and after treatment. RESULTS: NPY, TNF-α, c-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) levels were significantly reduced after steroid treatment. But the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) factor level increased after treatment compared to the initial evaluation. Lymphocytes and neutrophils also changed after drug treatment. Results indicated a high correlation between NPY and TNF-α. In addition to TNF-α, NPY, creatinine, and BUN presented a direct and significant relationship. ESR and BUN factors showed a positive and significant correlation regarding the length of hospitalization. However, the correlation between NPY and TNF-α with hospitalization length was insignificant. CONCLUSION: Since the current study had a significant association between NPY and TNF-α, the regulating function of this peptide in Covid-19 inflammatory processes may be validated. Enough that it is crucial to consider NPY as a marker and its antagonist as a potential Covid-19 therapy. Also, the considerable reduction in NPY levels after steroid therapy to lower inflammatory variables supports the regulatory function of this peptide in inflammatory processes.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '30 December 2024'}, 'day': '30'}",null,2024

Social isolation is a significant issue in an aging society, which can be associated with delayed medical care and difficulties in diagnosis. CASE: A 76-year-old man presented with altered mental status, left-sided weakness, and declining cognitive function over three months. He had limited social connections and an unknown medical history. Initial brain imaging showed communicating hydrocephalus. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed increased lymphocytes and high protein levels. Further imaging revealed multiple hyperintense lesions in the brain's white matter and acute ischemic stroke in specific areas.

No previous studies have evaluated the importance of IONM, especially in Gulf and Arab countries. We aimed to investigate the importance of IONM, as evaluated from a neurologist perspective in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Saudi Arabia through face-to-face interviews. The inclusion criterion was adult neurology consultants in Saudi Arabia. The instrument used was a self-administered questionnaire consisting of 20 items to evaluate the perceptions on IONM. Data collection was from January 2022 to June 2022. RESULTS: A total of 72 neurology consultants from Saudi Arabia participated in this study. The years of experience of the participants were 10-20 years (43.1%), most of whom worked in a tertiary healthcare center (72.2%), 31.9% had a certified neurologist trained in IONM, and approximately two-thirds of the institutions did not have an IONM setup (59.7%). Most neurologists believed that IONM should be part of neurology training programs (59.7%). Approximately, half of the respondents believed that IONM was mandatory (52.8%). CONCLUSION: IONM is considered the standard of care in many complex intracranial, spinal, and vascular surgeries. In our study, the perception of neurologists regarding IONM was promising, and the readiness of secondary and tertiary care centers to implement IONM was encouraging. Education, training, implementation, and regulations regarding IONM should be mandatory to prevent operative complications.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '30 December 2024'}, 'day': '30'}",null,2024

Followed by a spatial discriminating filter, only the strongly focused fraction traverses the setup, at the expense of efficiency. A numerical model, accounting for the pulse and material parameters via a Gaussian ABCD matrix, provides an estimate for the instantaneous beam waist and transmission efficiency, which enables us to evaluate the resulting contrast enhancement. The estimated contrast enhancement spans between 0.5 and 2.5 orders of magnitude, in conjunction with approximately 25%-90% estimated efficiency, depending on the pulse parameters.

All rights reserved.BACKGROUND: As a unique structure of the cervical spine, the occurrence, development and progression of the uncovertebral joint directly affect the stability and range of motion of the cervical spine, and are also closely related to the pathogenesis of cervical spondylosis. A thorough understanding of the developmental characteristics of the uncovertebral joint is of great significance for the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of cervical spondylosis. OBJECTIVE: By using imaging and three-dimensional reconstruction technology to measure and observe the cervical uncinate process-related angle in a large sample of different age groups, the aim is to reveal the characteristics of its changes with age and vertebral growth, as well as its relationship with cervical spine stability. METHODS: Using a retrospective research design, we collected 1 447 cases of raw CT imaging data that meet the study requirements for complete cervical spine segments. The raw data were imported into Mimics 21.0 software in DICOM format for post-processing and measurement of angle of uncinate process and sagittal angle of uncinate process. The data were grouped based on gender, age, and side. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: (1) With the increase of vertebral sequence, the angle of uncinate process increased in a V-shaped shape, and the lowest peak was at C5. The overall population showed a sharp peak with the increase of age, and the peak value mostly occurred in the age range of 30-39 years. (2) The sagittal angle of the uncinate process increased like a fishhook with the increase of the vertebral sequence, and the overall angle of the uncinate process increased with age, and the peak value mostly occurred in the age range of 20-29 years. The uncinate process angle and sagittal angle showed only partial significant differences between sides and genders (P < 0.05). (3) It is concluded that the angle of the uncinate process increased with the increase of vertebral sequence in a V-shaped manner. The sagittal angle of the uncinate process increases like a fish hook with increasing vertebral order, while the two angles generally peak with increasing age. The angle of the uncinate process is about 131°, which may be closely related to the stability of the cervical spine, while the sagittal angle of the uncinate process is about 14°, and its function may play a certain role in limiting the excessive rotation of the cervical spine.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '28 December 2024'}, 'day': '28'}",18,2024

All rights reserved.The gradual increase in the risks of constructions without structural planning in hillside areas characterizes the expansion of urbanization in Brazil. In this process of territorial occupation, constructions on soft clay soils represent significant structural hazards. This study aimed to evaluate structural instabilities in a public school in Florianópolis (SC, Brazil), using integrated geology, geotechnics, and geophysics data. This is a case study in an area characterized by the urbanization process of the West Side of the Costeira do Pirajubaé Massif. Geologically, the study area is composed of granitic rocks, soft clay deposits, and colluvial soils, in an environment of the upper third to the middle of the slope. For data analysis, geophysical, geotechnical, and geological methods were used. In the results, it was identified upstream colluvium, evidenced by the wide variety of soils (sandy, yellowish silt clay, of medium consistency), as well as gray clay deposits, ranging from very soft to hard, with distinct characteristics of the residual soils of the granitoid downstream, which are normally medium consistency brown to yellowish clays, expected for the B horizon. The results indicate a potential slip surface, which corresponds to a layer of soft clay deposits. Thus, it can be concluded that the observed instabilities, characterized by footing displacement, cracks, and subsidence demonstrate subsoil fragilities related to human interventions and the insufficiency of the drainage system, even when existing.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '27 December 2024'}, 'day': '27'}",50,2024

Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Nutrition Society.Objective: Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) are heavily advertised globally, and SSB consumption is linked to increased health risk. To reduce unhealthy food marketing, Chile implemented a regulation for products classified as high in energies, sugar, saturated fat or sodium, starting with a 2016 ban on child-targeted advertising of these products and adding a 06.00–22.00 daytime advertising ban in 2019. This study assesses changes in television advertising prevalence of ready-to-drink beverages, including and beyond SSB, to analyse how the beverage industry shifted its marketing strategies across Chile’s implementation phases. Design: Beverage advertisements were recorded during two randomly constructed weeks in April-May of 2016 (pre-implementation) through 2019 (daytime ban). Ad products were classified as ‘high-in’ or ‘non-high-in’ according to regulation nutrient thresholds. Ads were analysed for their programme placement and marketing content. Setting: Chile. Results: From pre-regulation to daytime ban, child-targeted, daytime and total ads decreased by 51·8 percentage points (p.p.), 51·5 p.p. and 61·8 p.p. for high-in products and increased by 62·9 p.p., 54·9 p.p. and 61·8 p.p. for non-high-in products (Ps < 0·001). Additionally, total ready-to-drink beverage ads increased by 5·4 p.p. and brand-only ads (no product shown) by 7 p.p. Conclusions: After the regulation implementation, ‘high-in’ ads fell significantly, but ‘non-high-in’ ads rose and continued using strategies targeting children and being aired during daytime. Given research showing that advertising one product can increase preferences for a different product from that same brand and product categories, broader food marketing regulation approaches may be needed to protect children from the harmful effects of food marketing.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '27 December 2024'}, 'day': '27'}",50,2024

Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of Weed Science Society of America.Understanding the effect of phosphorus (P) fertilization on weed interference with sweet corn is important for deciding appropriate fertilization levels and weed control programs. Field experiments were conducted in 2020 and 2021 in Belle Glade, FL, to determine the influence of P fertilization levels (0 or residual P, 62.5, and 120 kg P2O5 ha-1) on the critical period of weed control (CPWC) in sweet corn on organic soils. Experimental plots were subjected to increased duration of weed interference and weed-free period treatments for each P fertilization level. The beginning and end of the CPWC based on 5% and 10% acceptable yield loss (AYL) levels were determined by fitting log-logistic and Gompertz models to represent the increasing duration of weed interference and duration of the weed-free period, respectively. The log-logistic curves did not estimate the beginning of the CPWC at 5% AYL for 0 and 125 kg P2O5 ha-1 because the estimated upper limits of the curves were lower than the 95% relative yield used for estimation of 5% AYL. Based on a 10% AYL level, the length of the CPWC in sweet corn under optimum P fertilization levels was estimated to be 27 d, from the 6- to 7-leaf stage until the silking stage of growth. Reducing P fertilization by 50% increased the CPWC to 36 d, from the 5-leaf stage until the silking to blister stage of growth. Lack of P fertilization increased the CPWC to 64 d, from sweet corn emergence until the blister to milk stage of growth. These results show that the beginning of the CPWC in sweet corn is delayed and the end is shortened as P fertilization level increases. Therefore reduction in P fertilization will require a more intensive weed management program for sweet corn because of the prolonged duration of the CPWC.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '27 December 2024'}, 'day': '27'}",32,2024

All rights reserved.Objective: For young children experiencing an illness, adequate nutrition is critical for recovery and to prevent malnutrition, yet many children do not receive the recommended quantities of food during illness and recuperation. Our research applied a behavioural science lens to identify drivers of feeding behaviours, including barriers inhibiting caregivers from following the feeding guidelines. Design: In 2021, we conducted qualitative research informed by the behavioural design process. Data from in-depth interviews and observations were analysed for themes. Setting: Research was conducted in South Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Participants: Research participants included caregivers of young children, other family members, health workers and other community members. Results: Five key findings about behavioural drivers emerged: (1) poverty and scarcity impose practical constraints and a cognitive and emotional burden on caregivers; (2) health providers are distracted and discouraged from counselling on feeding during sick visits; (3) a focus on quality and hesitations about quantity obscure benefits of feeding greater amounts of available foods; (4) perceptions of inappropriate foods limit caregivers’ choices; and (5) deference to a child’s limited appetite leads to missed opportunities to encourage them to eat. Conclusions: Each of these behavioural drivers is triggered by one or more addressable features in caregivers’ and health workers’ environment, suggesting concrete opportunities for programmes to support caregivers and health workers to improve feeding of young children during illness and recovery. In other settings where these features of the environment are similar, the insights and programming implications are likely to translate.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '27 December 2024'}, 'day': '27'}",33,2024

All rights reserved.In the digital era, a hectic lifestyle and a lack of sufficient nutrition need the analysis of disease-specific aspects for the early detection of diseases in the human body. To identify the presence of heart diseases, electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters are analysed, while for identification of mental issues, electroencephalogram (EEG. These parameters' interdependency must be analysed to identify their cross-effects on different organs. For instance, improper heart functioning directly affects the normal functioning of the lungs, kidneys & liver. Continuous dysfunction of an organ indirectly causes other organs to become dysfunctional, thereby causing premature multipleorgan failure. To overcome this problem, anample diversity of algorithmic models has been defined by researchers over the years. These models need improved disease progression analysis and scalability. Inefficient system design causes clinical mistakes and reduces multiorgan analysis efficacy. This study presents an enhanced temporal analysis approach to determine illness development utilizing multiparametric analysis for a high-efficiency multi-organ analytical model. The machine learning algorithm is trained with temporal ECG, EEG, and blood records data. This data is used for building an augmented deep learning stack, which assists in evaluating the patient's current health condition and estimating progressive diseases that might affect other organs. The novelty & critical idea of the proposed model is that it utilizes an augmented combination of VGGNet-19, InceptionNet, and XceptionNet models to evaluate different diseases. Depending upon their disease-specific accuracy, these models are trained using other datasets for maximum performance. For instance, VGGNet-19 & models showcase the highest accuracy for EEG datasets. On the contrary, it has been shown that InceptionNet models exhibit superior performance when applied to electrocardiogram (ECG) signals, whereas XceptionNet is commonly employed for the classification of blood reports owing to its great efficacy in analysing one-dimensional data. These models are integrated to assess illnesses by utilizing immediate readings with a high level of efficiency. Upon collection of successively estimated readings, the model can predict disease progression with over 90% accuracy. This consistent performance across different disease types makes the system applicable for clinical usage. Furthermore, the proposed model is tested on few another dataset, and its performance and efficiency were compared with recent deep learning models, with an average 14% improvement in accuracy, 16% improvement in precision, 12% improvement in recall, and a 6% increase in computational delay was observed. While the model requires a significant training delay, the evaluation delay is moderate due to the disease-specific model design, making the system applicable for real-time clinical usage.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '25 December 2024'}, 'day': '25'}",38,2024

All rights reserved.Introduction. Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is one of the most serious threats to global public health, causing over 700 thousand deaths annually. In addition to the social burden, AMR generates high medical costs, and estimating these at the hospital level has been the subject of research in many international studies. Material and methods. A comprehensive study was conducted, encompassing 172 cases of invasive infections recorded in patients hospitalized at the “Timofei Mosneaga” Republican Clinical Hospital, from which strains of antimicrobial-resistant E. coli, K. pneumoniae, A. bau-mannii, and P. aeruginosa were isolated in the years 2019-2021. Based on data regarding the duration of hospitalization, treatment costs, and expenses for investigations, indicators such as average cost, the median, minimum and maximum values of treatment, including the cost of antibiotics and laboratory analyses, were calculated. Results. The economic impact indicators of AMR at the hospital level include: the duration of hospitalization, the total costs of a treated case, the costs of antibiotics, and the costs of laboratory analyses. In the structure of microorganisms isolated from the patients included in the study, K. pneumoniae predominates, accounting for 44.2%, and the total treatment cost for this organism was the highest at 202731.5 dollars. The maximum duration of hospitalization was recorded in patients from whom A. baumannii was isolated (27.7 days). Conclusions. The resistance of strains isolated from patients has directly contributed to the extension of the hospitalization period. The resistance of A. baumannii and K. pneumoniae species has predominantly led to the increase in the economic burden of AMR.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '24 December 2024'}, 'day': '24'}",21,2024

Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of Weed Science Society of America.Palmer amaranth can grow 4.2 mm in height per degree day; hence, delays of a few days in weed control deployment can result in applications of herbicides to weeds that are larger than those for which the herbicide label recommends. Therefore, it is critically necessary to understand the effect of plant size at the time of herbicide application in conjunction with herbicide spray solution and nozzle type pairings on the effectiveness of weed management programs in the Enlist E3 and XtendFlex production systems. Field experiments were conducted in 2020, in no-crop conditions, at two locations in Arkansas, to evaluate the influence of Palmer amaranth size on its control with glufosinate, dicamba, and 2,4-D applied alone and in mixture with specific nozzle pairings as mandated by label requirements. Also, a laboratory experiment was conducted to evaluate the droplet size and velocity of the spray solutions and nozzles used in the field experiments. A 5- and 10-percentage point reduction in control was observed when dicamba (66%) and 2,4-D (63%) were applied alone, respectively, compared with those herbicides mixed with glufosinate (71% and 73%, respectively). Palmer amaranth density increased to 55, 73, 100, 115, and 140 plants m-2 when plants were sprayed at heights of 15, 25, 41, 61, and 76 cm, respectively, compared with plants that were sprayed when they were 5 cm tall (9 plants m-2). Nozzle type did not affect weed control or density. The percentage of driftable fines increased when a mixture of glufosinate and 2,4-D were used compared with 2,4-D alone. Effective short-term and long-term chemical control of Palmer amaranth will require growers to correctly time their weed management practices and overlay residuals, and expect the need for sequential applications.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '22 December 2024'}, 'day': '22'}",53,2024

Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of Weed Science Society of America.In New Mexico chile pepper production, pendimethalin is traditionally applied shortly after crop thinning, which is 9 to 10 wk after crop seeding. Pendimethalin applications before crop thinning may be a method for controlling early-season weeds in chile pepper; however, chile pepper tolerance to early-season applications of pendimethalin is poorly understood. We conducted a greenhouse study to evaluate young chile pepper responses to pendimethalin. We also conducted a field study to determine weed and chile pepper responses to early-season, postemergence-directed pendimethalin in combination with herbicides registered for preemergence applications. The greenhouse study included three treatments administered when chile pepper was at the four-leaf stage: (i) pendimethalin applied to foliage and soil, (ii) pendimethalin applied to soil only, and (iii) a nontreated control. The field study included four treatments: (i) preemergence applications of napropamide followed by postemergence-directed pendimethalin at 5 wk after crop seeding, (ii) preemergence applications of clomazone followed by postemergence-directed pendimethalin at 5 wk after crop seeding, (iii) postemergence-directed pendimethalin without preemergence herbicides, and (iv) nontreated, weed-free control. We conducted the field study at two sites that differed in soil texture. Pendimethalin application rates were maximum labeled rates for the specific soil. Results from the greenhouse study indicated that pendimethalin applied to foliage and soil stunted two of five cultivars, whereas pendimethalin applied to soil did not affect chile pepper height, fresh weight, dry weight, or root area. Results from the field study indicated that postemergence-directed pendimethalin did not affect chile pepper height or fruit yield, or cause visible symptoms of herbicide injury. Postemergence-directed pendimethalin reduced the densities of weeds, including junglerice. The results of this study indicate that postemergence-directed applications of pendimethalin at 5 wk after crop seeding do not cause crop injury or yield loss in chile pepper, while providing some weed control benefits.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '22 December 2024'}, 'day': '22'}",36,2024

The objective of this study was to determine the reaction of nine cultivars of Urochloa to the pathogens Pyricularia oryzae Triticum lineage (PoTl), P. pennisetigena, P. urashimae, and P. grisea. The virulence of seven races of PoTl to signal grass cultivars was also evaluated. There was variation in the pathogenicity and virulence of Pyricularia species and PoTl races in different signal grass cultivars. The cultivars Ipyporã, BRS Tupi, and Xaraés were the most resistant to the different blast pathogen species and PoTl races. Therefore, it is recommended to cultivate these varieties in areas adjacent to wheat or in crop-livestock integration.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '21 December 2024'}, 'day': '21'}",30,2024

All rights reserved.Water sources in the Brazilian semi-arid region commonly contain high levels of dissolved salts in their composition, standing out as one of the abiotic stresses that limit the expansion of irrigated fruit growing, especially salt stress-sensitive crops such as sour passion fruit. Thus, the use of elicitors, such as proline, can be an effective alternative to mitigate salt stress in plants. In this context, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of foliar application of proline on chlorophyll fluorescence, growth, quality and tolerance of sour passion fruit irrigated with saline water during the seedling formation phase. The experiment was conducted from July to October 2022, under greenhouse conditions in Campina Grande, PB, Brazil, using a completely randomized design, in a 5 × 4 factorial scheme, with five levels of electrical conductivity of irrigation water-ECw (0.6, 1.2, 1.8, 2.4 and 3.0 dS m-1) and four concentrations of proline (0, 5, 10 and 15 mM), with four replicates and two plants per plot. Water salinity from 0.6 dS m-1 reduces the maximum fluorescence, variable fluorescence, quantum yield of photosystem II and growth of ‘BRS GA1’ sour passion fruit seedlings. Foliar application of proline at concentrations ranging from 6 to 8.05 mM increases the growth in plant height, stem diameter and leaf area of sour passion fruit seedlings. The sour passion fruit genotype ‘BRS GA1’ is sensitive to water salinity, with a salinity threshold level of 0.6 dS m-1 and a reduction per unit increase in electrical conductivity of 10.49%.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '21 December 2024'}, 'day': '21'}",28,2024

To mitigate the damage and reduce the impact on human health and the environment that results from the persistent and indiscriminate use of chemical insecticides, it is crucial to consider the use of botanical insecticides as a fundamental alternative for pest control. The aim was therefore to investigate the stimulus-response of the hydroalcoholic crude extract of Ocimum campechianum and of its dichloromethane (DCM) fraction on A. monuste orseis. Leaf consumption (cm2) of caterpillars exposed to the extract, caterpillar mortality in 24 h, total caterpillar mortality, pupal mortality, pupal period duration, and morphological malformation in adults were evaluated. Feeding the caterpillars for eight days with cabbage impregnated with the crude extract and its DCM fraction resulted in decreased caterpillar feeding, increased larval mortality (90%), lengthening of the pupal period (two days), and an increase in adult deformation (50%). Therefore, the crude extract of O. campechianum and its DCM fraction have potential for use in the alternative control of A. monuste orseis.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '21 December 2024'}, 'day': '21'}",20,2024

This study aimed to evaluate the quality parameters of Tifton 85 (Cynodon spp.) using digital images, relating spectral indices to the quality parameters of this forage. In the experimental area, four levels of nitrogen fertilization were applied and the analyses were made at different times after the standardization cut (14, 28, 42, and 56 days). The quality parameters evaluated were mineral matter, crude protein, and neutral detergent fiber. From images obtained in the visible (RGB) and near-infrared (RGNIR) spectral regions, spectral indices were generated. Principal component analysis was applied to summarize the information obtained by spectral indices into a single principal component (PC1). PC1 associated with spectral indices was related to forage quality parameters for each cutting time using simple quadratic regression models. The relationships between mineral matter and spectral indices were variable over time. Crude protein and neutral detergent fiber showed the highest relationships with the spectral indices obtained by RGNIR images already at the initial times. Thus, although the RGB images have shown satisfactory results to obtain information about the quality of Tifton 85, the NIR band tends to increase the reliability of the relationships at early times.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '21 December 2024'}, 'day': '21'}",26,2024

Published by Cambridge University Press.Objectives Qualitative methods allow in-depth exploration of patient experiences and can provide context for healthcare decision making. Frameworks for patient-based evidence in health technology assessment (HTA) are expanding; yet, how extensively qualitative methods are currently used is unclear. This review characterized the extent and quality of qualitative data submitted to National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH) for HTA. Methods NICE and CADTH submissions from September 2019 to August 2021 were reviewed. Submission characteristics and features of patient-based evidence included within submissions were extracted. The quality of qualitative reporting was assessed using the CASP checklist. Results Patient-based evidence was included in 83/107 NICE and 119/124 CADTH submissions. A small proportion described qualitative data collection (NICE=14; CADTH=24) and analysis (NICE=6; CADTH=9) methods. One-to-one interviews were the most common data collection method, and thematic analysis was exclusively used. Thirty-three percent of NICE submissions scored >7 yes responses on CASP, versus 78 percent of CADTH submissions. Conclusions Although patient-based evidence was common in the submissions reviewed, only 14/107 NICE and 24/124 CADTH submissions involved formal qualitative data collection. Use of formal analysis methods was even rarer and reporting tended to be brief. At present, there is little guidance about qualitative evidence most likely to be informative and therefore to potentially impact decision making. Ensuring, however, that qualitative data are collected and analyzed in a systematic, rigorous way will maximize their usefulness and ensure that patient voices are clearly heard.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '21 December 2024'}, 'day': '21'}",31,2024

Cotton injury from off-target movement of imazapyr has been observed in South Carolina. Field experiments were conducted twice at the Edisto Research and Education Center (EREC) in 2021 and 2022, and once at the Pee Dee Research and Education Center (PDREC) in 2022, to evaluate the response of cotton at two growth stages to imazapyr at 0.1×, 0.05×, 0.025×, 0.0125×, and 0.00625× of the normal use rate of 0.84 kg ae ha-1. Injury to cotton at the vegetative stage was 86% and 74% at 0.1× and 0.05× imazapyr rates 28 d after application (DAA). Cotton height ranged from 23 to 93 cm at all three locations. Yield at the EREC location in 2021 was reduced by 79%, 48%, and 31% at the 0.1×, 0.05×, and 0.025× rates of imazapyr, respectively. Similar reductions from imazapyr were observed at both EREC and PDREC in 2022. Injury to cotton at the reproductive stage based on visual estimates at 28 DAA ranged from 95% to 64% for the 0.1× to 0.0125× rates, respectively. Cotton height at the reproductive stage was reduced to 59% of the untreated control 28 DAA when the 0.1× rate of imazapyr was applied. Seed cotton (which included both seed and lint) yield ranged from 0 to 2,880 kg ha-1 at the three locations in both years. Seed cotton yield was lowest when imazapyr was applied at the 0.1× to 0.025× rates. Cotton exposure to imazapyr at the vegetative and reproductive growth stages resulted in plant injury, height, and yield reductions, especially at the higher rates of imazapyr. The greatest reduction in cotton growth and yield was observed after exposure at the reproductive growth stage regardless of imazapyr rate. In summary, the magnitude of cotton response to imazapyr depends on crop growth stage and imazapyr concentration at the time of exposure with the greatest impact occurring at the reproductive growth stage.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '21 December 2024'}, 'day': '21'}",23,2024

This study describes the development and characteristics of a pilot community-led meal-kit service (SouthEats) and evaluates key implementation outcomes of adoption, acceptability, and feasibility among households experiencing less income. Design: We utilised a mixed methods study design, including data from administrative records, customer surveys and worker interviews. Thematic qualitative analyses and descriptive quantitative analyses were conducted to illuminate the characteristics and extent the pilot meal-kit service was adopted, acceptable, and financially feasible among the target populations.

Results: During the pilot period, sixty-seven community members signed up for the meal-kit service, with 52 % making recurring purchases. Our results suggest that the meal-kit service is acceptable among people living in low food access areas. Our feasibility analysis indicates that, although not without challenges, the SouthEats model could be financially feasible.

Setting: Noncommunicable diseases (NCD) are the leading cause of premature death in PICTs and in many jurisdictions globally. An NCD crisis has been declared in the Pacific, and food taxation policy has been recommended to address the dietary risk factors associated with. Progress is unclear. Results: Of the twenty-two PICTs included in the study, fourteen had food taxation policies and five introduced excise taxes. Processed foods, sugar and salt were the main target of excise taxes. A total of eighty-four food taxation policy changes were identified across all food groups. There was a total of 279 taxes identified by food group, of which 85 % were tariffs and 15 % were excise taxes. Individual tax rates varied substantially. The predominant tax design was ad valorem, and this was followed by volumetric. Conclusions: A quarter of PICTs have introduced food excise taxes from 2000 to 2020. Further excise taxes, specifically tiered or nutrient-specific designs, could be introduced and more systematically applied to a broader range of unhealthy foods.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '21 December 2024'}, 'day': '21'}",42,2024

Exploratory findings from a randomised experiment on the impacts of health warning labels on sugar-sweetened beverages,Public Health Nutrition,"[('Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information', 'Singapore City', 'Singapore')]","© The Author(s), 2023. Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Nutrition Society.Objective: Health warning labels (HWL) have been suggested to be effective in reducing consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB). Yet, the efficacy and acceptability of SSB HWL of different formats (textual/pictorial) and severity remain unclear. This exploratory study aims to examine the extent and mechanism through which HWL of different formats and severity may affect responses towards the HWL and SSB consumption. Design: Randomised online experiment. Participants were exposed to images of a hypothetical SSB bearing a HWL of one of three conditions: text-only HWL, moderately severe pictorial HWL and highly severe pictorial HWL. They then responded to theory-based affective, cognitive and behavioural measures. Setting: Singapore Participants: One hundred and twenty-seven young adult consumers from a public university Results: Direct effects were found for fear, avoidance, reactance and acceptability of the HWL, but not attitude, intention or motivation to consume less SSB. Pictorial (moderately severe and highly severe) HWL were associated with greater fear, avoidance, and reactance, and lower acceptability than text-only HWL. There was weak evidence that highly severe pictorial HWL resulted in greater reactance than moderately severe pictorial HWL. Fear mediated the effect of HWL of different severity levels on avoidance, reactance, intention and motivation, but not for attitude or acceptability. Conclusions: Exploratory findings indicate that although pictorial HWL were less acceptable, they may still be effective in influencing intention and motivation to reduce SSB consumption through the psychological mechanism of fear. Hence, graphic HWL should not be dismissed too quickly when considering strategies for reducing SSB consumption.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '21 December 2024'}, 'day': '21'}",37,2024

All rights reserved.In semi-arid regions, the use of brackish water for irrigation can reduce crop yields. However, the use of mineral fertilizer has been tested to mitigate salt stress. In this context, the objective was to evaluate the effect of salt stress at different phenological stages on the yield of peanut under potassium fertilization. The experiment was carried out from August to November 2021, in the experimental area of the Universidade da Integração da Lusofonia Afro-Brasileira (UNILAB), Redenção, Ceará, Brazil. The experimental design was completely randomized (CRD), in a 6 × 3 factorial scheme, with 6 replicates. Six strategies of irrigation with brackish water were applied from the following stages: vegetative (S1); flowering (S2); gynophore appearance (S3); pod formation (S4); fruiting (S5) and without salt stress (S6), and three doses of potassium: 0, 50 and 100% of the recommended dose. The use of brackish water in the vegetative stage led to lower pod length, pod mass, number of pods, number of marketable pods and yield. The dose corresponding to 100% of the recommended potassium dose mitigated salt stress in the pod formation and flowering stages, promoting a greater number of marketable pods, number of non-marketable pods, total number of pods and pod mass. The use of water with lower salinity throughout the cycle promoted greater pod mass, number of marketable pods and yield.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '21 December 2024'}, 'day': '21'}",28,2024

Published by Cambridge University Press.The dominant paradigm of experiments in the social and behavioral sciences views an experiment as a test of a theory, where the theory is assumed to generalize beyond the experiment's specific conditions. According to this view, which Alan Newell once characterized as playing twenty questions with nature, theory is advanced one experiment at a time, and the integration of disparate findings is assumed to happen via the scientific publishing process. In this article, we argue that the process of integration is at best inefficient, and at worst it does not, in fact, occur. We further show that the challenge of integration cannot be adequately addressed by recently proposed reforms that focus on the reliability and replicability of individual findings, nor simply by conducting more or larger experiments. Rather, the problem arises from the imprecise nature of social and behavioral theories and, consequently, a lack of commensurability across experiments conducted under different conditions. Therefore, researchers must fundamentally rethink how they design experiments and how the experiments relate to theory. We specifically describe an alternative framework, integrative experiment design, which intrinsically promotes commensurability and continuous integration of knowledge. In this paradigm, researchers explicitly map the design space of possible experiments associated with a given research question, embracing many potentially relevant theories rather than focusing on just one. Researchers then iteratively generate theories and test them with experiments explicitly sampled from the design space, allowing results to be integrated across experiments. Given recent methodological and technological developments, we conclude that this approach is feasible and would generate more-reliable, more-cumulative empirical and theoretical knowledge than the current paradigm - and with far greater efficiency.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '21 December 2024'}, 'day': '21'}",187,2024

Design: Observational cohort study using beverage purchasing data linked to a supermarket database. ANOVA was used to compare total household purchase volumes (L) and the contribution of beverages purchased by category, household composition (size), household income (four categories from New Zealand (NZ) < $30 000 to > $90 000), and over time (trend from 2015 to 2019). Setting: Aotearoa NZ. Participants: ∼1800 households in the NielsenIQ Homescan® market research panel. Results: In 2019, the mean (SD) annual household purchase volume and relative contribution to total beverage volume of SSBs were 72·3 (93·0) L and 33 %, respectively. Corresponding values for AFSBs were 32·5 (79·3) L (15 %), and USBs were 112·5 (100·9) L (52 %). Larger households purchased more of all beverage types except AFSBs. Total purchases were similar by income, but households earning < $NZ 30 000 purchased fewer AFSBs and USBs (but not SSBs) than households earning > $NZ 90 000. Total and USB purchases were unchanged over time, but SSBs dropped by 5·9 L (P-trend = 0·04), and AFSBs increased by 5·3 L (P-trend = 0·00). Conclusions: USBs contributed the most to household beverage purchases. Total purchases were higher for larger households and similar by income, including for SSBs.

Published by Cambridge University Press.Chickenpox (varicella) is a rare occurrence in healthcare settings in the USA, but can be transmitted to healthcare workers (HCWs) from patients with herpes zoster who, in turn, can potentially transmit it further to unimmunized, immunosuppressed, at-risk, vulnerable patients. It is uncommon due to the inclusion of varicella vaccination in the recommended immunization schedule for children and screening for varicella immunity in HCWs during employment. We present a case report of hospital-acquired chickenpox in a patient who developed the infection during his prolonged hospital stay through a HCW who had contracted chickenpox after exposure to our patient's roommate with herpes zoster. There was no physical contact between the roommates, but both patients had a common HCW as caregiver. The herpes zoster patient was placed in airborne precautions immediately, but the HCW continued to work and have physical contact with our patient. The HCW initially developed chickenpox 18 days after exposure to the patient with herpes zoster, and our patient developed chickenpox 17 days after the HCW. The timeline and two incubation periods, prior to our patient developing chickenpox, indicate transmission of chickenpox in the HCW from exposure to the herpes zoster patient and subsequently to our patient. The case highlights the potential for nosocomial transmission of chickenpox (varicella) to unimmunized HCWs from exposure to patients with herpes zoster and further transmission to unimmunized patients. Verification of the immunization status of HCWs at the time of employment, mandating immunity, furloughing unimmunized staff after exposure to herpes zoster, and postexposure prophylaxis with vaccination or varicella zoster immunoglobulin (Varizig) will minimize the risk of transmission of communicable diseases like chickenpox in healthcare settings. Additionally, establishing patients' immunity, heightened vigilance and early identification of herpes zoster in hospitalized patients, and initiation of appropriate infection control immediately will further prevent such occurrences and improve patient safety.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '19 December 2024'}, 'day': '19'}",15,2024

Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Association for Clinical and Translational Science.Introduction: The institutions (i.e., hubs) making up the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded network of Clinical and Translational Science Awards (CTSAs) share a mission to turn observations into interventions to improve public health. Recently, the focus of the CTSAs has turned increasingly from translational research (TR) to translational science (TS). The current NIH Funding Opportunity Announcement (PAR-21-293) for CTSAs stipulates that pilot studies funded through the CTSAs must be focused on understanding a scientific or operational principle underlying a step of the translational process with the goal of developing generalizable solutions to accelerate translational research. This new directive places Pilot Program administrators in the position of arbiters with the task of distinguishing between TR and TS projects. The purpose of this study was to explore the utility of a set of TS principles set forth by NCATS for distinguishing between TR and TS. Methods: Twelve CTSA hubs collaborated to generate a list of Translational Science Principles questions. Twenty-nine Pilot Program administrators used these questions to evaluate 26 CTSA-funded pilot studies. Results: Factor analysis yielded three factors: Generalizability/Efficiency, Disruptive Innovation, and Team Science. The Generalizability/Efficiency factor explained the largest amount of variance in the questions and was significantly able to distinguish between projects that were verified as TS or TR (t = 6.92, p <.001) by an expert panel. Conclusions: The seven questions in this factor may be useful for informing deliberations regarding whether a study addresses a question that aligns with NCATS' vision of TS.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '18 December 2024'}, 'day': '18'}",28,2024

Published by Cambridge University Press.While some species have affiliative and even cooperative interactions between individuals of different social groups, humans are alone in having durable, positive-sum, interdependent relationships across unrelated social groups. Our capacity to have harmonious relationships that cross group boundaries is an important aspect of our species' success, allowing for the exchange of ideas, materials, and ultimately enabling cumulative cultural evolution. Knowledge about the conditions required for peaceful intergroup relationships is critical for understanding the success of our species and building a more peaceful world. How do humans create harmonious relationships across group boundaries and when did this capacity emerge in the human lineage? Answering these questions involves considering the costs and benefits of intergroup cooperation and aggression, for oneself, one's group, and one's neighbor. Taking a game theoretical perspective provides new insights into the difficulties of removing the threat of war and reveals an ironic logic to peace-the factors that enable peace also facilitate the increased scale and destructiveness of conflict. In what follows, I explore the conditions required for peace, why they are so difficult to achieve, and when we expect peace to have emerged in the human lineage. I argue that intergroup cooperation was an important component of human relationships and a selective force in our species history beginning at least 300 thousand years. But the preconditions for peace only emerged in the past 100 thousand years and likely coexisted with intermittent intergroup violence which would have also been an important and selective force in our species' history.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '16 December 2024'}, 'day': '16'}",224,2024

Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of the European Psychiatric Association.Background The conceptualization of negative symptoms (NS) in schizophrenia is still controversial. Recent confirmatory factor-analytic studies suggested that the bi-dimensional model (motivational deficit [MAP] and expressive deficit [EXP]) may not capture the complexity of NS structure, which could be better defined by a five-factor (five NS domains) or a hierarchical model (five NS domains as first-order factors, and MAP and EXP, as second-order factors). A validation of these models is needed to define the structure of NS. To evaluate the validity and temporal stability of the five-factor or the hierarchical structure of the brief negative symptom scale (BNSS) in individuals with schizophrenia (SCZ), exploring associations between these models with cognition, social cognition, functional capacity, and functioning at baseline and at 4 years follow-up. Methods Clinical variables were assessed using state-of-the-art tools in 612 SCZ at two-time points. The validity of the five-factor and the hierarchical models was analyzed through structural equation models. Results The two models had both a good fit and showed a similar pattern of associations with external validators at the two-time points, with minor variations. The five-factor solution had a slightly better fit. The associations with external validators favored the five-factor structure. Conclusions Our findings suggest that both five-factor and hierarchical models provide a valid conceptualization of NS in relation to external variables and that five-factor solution provides the best balance between parsimony and granularity to summarize the BNSS structure. This finding has important implications for the study of pathophysiological mechanisms and the development of new treatments.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '15 December 2024'}, 'day': '15'}",68,2024

Methods We conducted a scoping review by searching clinicaltrials.gov using the search term telemedicine and limiting results to randomized trials or observational studies registered between January 2012 and October 2023. We then reviewed trial registration data to determine if any of the outcomes assessed in the trials measured effect on clinicians' time. Results We found 113 studies and of these 78 studies of telemedicine met the inclusion criteria and were included. Nine (12 percent) of the 78 studies had some measure of clinician time as a primary outcome, and 11 (14 percent) as a secondary outcome.

Conclusion: National sentinel food lists can provide reliable data at subnational levels for most food groups, with some variability by country and sub-region. Assessing the accuracy of national sentinel food lists, especially for fruits and vegetables, before using them at the subnational level could avoid potentially underestimating dietary diversity and provide more accurate local information for programmes, policy and research.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '15 December 2024'}, 'day': '15'}",33,2024

Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Nutrition Society.Objective: Screen use at mealtimes is associated with poor dietary and psychosocial outcomes in children and is disproportionately prevalent among families of low socio-economic position (SEP). This study aimed to explore experiences of reducing mealtime screen use in mothers of low SEP with young children. Design: Motivational interviews, conducted via Zoom or telephone, addressed barriers and facilitators to reducing mealtime screen use. Following motivational interviews, participants co-designed mealtime screen use reduction strategies and trialled these for 3-4 weeks. Follow-up semi-structured interviews then explored maternal experiences of implementing strategies, including successes and difficulties. Transcripts were analysed thematically. Setting: Australia. Participants: Fourteen mothers who had no university education and a child between six months and six years old. Results: A range of strategies aimed to reduce mealtime screen use were co-designed. The most widely used strategies included changing mealtime location and parental modelling of expected behaviours. Experiences were influenced by mothers' levels of parenting self-efficacy and mealtime consistency, included changes to mealtime foods and an increased value of mealtimes. Experiences were reportedly easier, more beneficial and offered more opportunities for family communication, than anticipated. Change required considerable effort. However, effort decreased with consistency. Conclusions: The diverse strategies co-designed by mothers highlight the importance of understanding why families engage in mealtime screen use and providing tailored advice for reduction. Although promising themes were identified, in this motivated sample, changing established mealtime screen use habits still required substantial effort. Embedding screen-free mealtime messaging into nutrition promotion from the inception of eating will be important.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '15 December 2024'}, 'day': '15'}",50,2024

We have used the 887.5 MHz Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey DR1 to measure the radio emission from morphological early-type galaxies brighter than KS = 9.5 selected from the 2MASS Redshift Survey, HyperLEDA, and RC3. In line with previous studies, we find median radio power increases with infrared luminosity, with P1.4 ∝ L2.2K, although the scatter about this relation spans several orders of magnitude. All 40 of the MK < -25.7 early-type galaxies in our sample have measured radio flux densities that are more than 2σ above the background noise, with 1.4 GHz radio powers spanning ∼3 × 1020 to ∼3 × 1025 W/Hz-1. Cross-matching our sample with integral field spectroscopy of early-type galaxies reveals that the most powerful radio sources preferentially reside in galaxies with relatively low angular momentum (i.e. slow rotators). While the infrared colours of most galaxies in our early-type sample are consistent with passive galaxies with negligible star formation and the radio emission produced by active galactic nuclei or AGN remnants, very low levels of star formation could power the weakest radio sources with little effect on many other star formation rate tracers.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '15 December 2024'}, 'day': '15'}",51,2024

Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Nutrition Society.Objective: To explore the perspectives, barriers and enablers on salt reduction in out-of-home sectors in Malaysia among street food vendors, caterers and consumers. Design: A qualitative study involving twenty-two focus group discussions and six in-depth interviews was conducted, recorded and transcribed verbatim. An inductive thematic analysis approach was employed to analyse the data. Setting: Two in-depth interviews and twenty-two focus group discussions were conducted face-to-face. Four in-depth interviews were conducted online. Participants: Focus group discussions were conducted among twenty-three street food vendors, twenty-one caterers and seventy-six consumers of various eateries. In-depth interviews were conducted among two street food vendors and four caterers, individually. Results: Consumers and food operators perceived a high-salt intake within Malaysia’s out-of-home food sectors. Food operators emphasised the necessity for a comprehensive salt reduction policy in the out-of-home sector involving all stakeholders. Consumers faced limited awareness and knowledge, counterproductive practices among food operators and challenges in accessing affordable low-Na food products, whereas food operators faced the lack of standardised guidelines and effective enforcement mechanisms and uncooperative consumer practices. Both groups expressed that food quality and price of salt were also the barriers, and they advocated for awareness promotion, enhanced regulation of manufactured food products and stricter enforcement targeting vendors. Consumers also suggested promoting and recognising health-conscious food premises, whereas food operators suggested on knowledge enhancement tailored to them, strategies for gaining consumers acceptance and maintaining food quality. Conclusions: These findings provide valuable insights that serve as foundational evidence for developing and implementing salt reduction policies within Malaysia’s out-of-home sectors.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '15 December 2024'}, 'day': '15'}",56,2024

The amplifier delivers an output power exceeding 154 W at a pulse repetition rate of 1 MHz with custom-designed 48 pump passes. The exceptional thermal management on the thin disk through high-quality bonding, efficient heat dissipation and a fully locked spectrum collectively contributes to achieving a remarkable optical-to-optical efficiency of 61% and a near-diffraction-limit beam quality with an M2 factor of 1.06. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the highest conversion efficiency reported in ultrafast thin-disk regenerative amplifiers. Furthermore, the amplifier operates at room temperature and exhibits exceptional stability, with root mean square stability of less than 0.33%. This study significantly represents advances in the field of laser amplification systems, particularly in terms of efficiency and average power. This advantageous combination of high efficiency and diffraction limitation positions the thin-disk regenerative amplifier as a promising solution for a wide range of scientific and industrial applications.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '15 December 2024'}, 'day': '15'}",33,2024

Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Nutrition Society.Objective: This study aimed to determine the prevalence and determinants of goitre among children aged 6-12 years at South Kordofan state. Design: This was a cross-sectional facility-based study. Setting: The study was conducted in twenty villages of South Kordofan state during a medical mission. Participants: All 575 school-age children (6-12 years) who attended the medical day were examined for clinical assessment of goitre. Results: The prevalence of goitre among children of South Kordofan was 42·8 % (grade 1: 15·7 %, grade 2: 27·1 %). Only 24·2 % of caregivers reported using iodised salt. Mothers working as farmers (OR: 3·209, CI 95 % 1·437, 7·167; P = 0·004) and children of Darforian tribes (OR: 21·799, CI 95 % 2·566, 185·226; P = 0·005) were found to be significantly associated with higher prevalence of goitre among children. This contrasts with children of African tribes, where they were found to have less goitre prevalence (OR: 0·432, CI 95 % 0·213, 0·875; P = 0·02). Iodised salt utilisation (OR = 0·523, CI 95 % 0·320, 0·854; P = 0·01) was found associated with a lower prevalence of goitre.

All rights reserved.Objective: We assessed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the protocol adaptations on cost and cost-effectiveness of community management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) program in South Sudan. Design: Retrospective program expenditure-based analysis of non-governmental organisation (NGO) CMAM programs for COVID-19 period (April 2020–December 2021) in respect to pre-COVID period (January 2019–March 2020). Setting: Study was conducted as part of a bigger evaluation study in South Sudan. Participants: International and national NGOs operating CMAM programs under the nutrition cluster participated in the study. Results: The average cost per child recovered from the programme declined by 20 % during COVID from $133 (range: $34–1174) pre-COVID to $107 (range: $20–333) during COVID. The cost per child recovered was negatively correlated with programme size (pre-COVID r-squared = 0·58; during COIVD r-squared = 0·50). Programmes with higher enrollment were cheaper compared with those with low enrolment. Salaries, ready to use food and community activities accounted for over two-thirds of the cost per recovery during both pre-COVID (69 %) and COVID (79 %) periods. While cost per child recovered decreased during COVID period, it did not negatively impact on the programme outcome. Enrolment increased by an average of 19·8 % and recovery rate by 4·6 % during COVID period. Conclusions: Costs reduced with no apparent negative implication on recovery rates after implementing the COVID CMAM protocol adaptations with a strong negative correlation between cost and programme size. This suggests that investing in capacity, screening and referral at existing CMAM sites to enable expansion of caseload maybe a preferable strategy to increasing the number of CMAM sites in South Sudan.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '14 December 2024'}, 'day': '14'}",30,2024

Enrollment includes online consent to share data and optional consent to provide saliva for genomic analysis. SPARK's recruitment strategies include social media and support of a nation-wide network of clinical sites. This study evaluates SPARK's recruitment strategies to enroll a core study population. Methods: Individuals who joined between January 31, 2018, and May 29, 2019 were included in the analysis. Data include sociodemographic characteristics, clinical site referral, the website URL used to join, how the participant heard about SPARK, enrollment completion (online registration, study consents, and returning saliva sample), and completion of the baseline questionnaire. Logistic regressions were performed to evaluate the odds of core participant status (completing enrollment and baseline questionnaire) by recruitment strategy. Results: In total, 31,715 individuals joined during the study period, including 40% through a clinical site. Overall, 88% completed online registration, 46% returned saliva, and 38% were core participants. Those referred by a clinical site were almost twice as likely to be core participants. Those who directly visited the SPARK website or performed a Google search were more likely to be core participants than those who joined through social media. Discussion: Being a core participant may be associated with the “personal” connection and support provided by a clinical site and/or site staff, as well as greater motivation to seek research opportunities. Findings from this study underscore the value of adopting a multimodal recruitment approach that combines social media and a physical presence.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '14 December 2024'}, 'day': '14'}",53,2024

Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of the Social Science History Association.Modern colonialism from the eighteenth century onward encompassed most of the world's surface. Today, the world is different. In theory at least, nation-states rather than empires and colonies are the global norm. The sorts of colonial conquests that mark earlier centuries appear to have ended. But does this mean colonialism in the past is not relevant for the present? Scholarly and popular discussions allude to the idea that past colonialism impacts the present, using a variety of terms like legacies, imprints, vestiges, ruins, or afterlives. Yet existing scholarship has yet to fully clarify and catalog the specific processes and mechanisms that connect colonial history with its putative legacies. This essay, based upon the 2022 Presidential Address to the Social Science History Association, identifies and discusses four such processes and mechanisms or modes of reverberation: (1) continued colonialism through simple reproduction, (2) the persistence of power through formal and informal institutionalization, (3) path dependent historical trajectories (or colonial institutionalism), and (4) colonialism's archive of meaning.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '14 December 2024'}, 'day': '14'}",87,2024

Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Association for Clinical and Translational Science.Introduction: Despite the central importance of cross-disciplinary collaboration in the Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) network and the implementation of various programs designed to enhance collaboration, rigorous evidence for the efficacy of these approaches is lacking. We conducted a novel randomized controlled trial (RCT; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05395286) of a promising approach to enhance collaboration readiness and behavior among 95 early career scholars from throughout the CTSA network. Methods: Participants were randomly assigned (within two cohorts) to participate in an Innovation Lab, a week-long immersive collaboration experience, or to a treatment-as-usual control group. Primary outcomes were change in metrics of self-reported collaboration readiness (through 12-month follow-up) and objective collaboration network size from bibliometrics (through 21 months); secondary outcomes included self-reported number of grants submitted and, among Innovation Lab participants only, reactions to the Lab experience (through 12 months). Results: Short-term reactions from Innovation Lab participants were quite positive, and controlled evidence for a beneficial impact of Innovation Labs over the control condition was observed in the self-reported number of grant proposals in the intent-to-treat sample. Primary measures of collaboration readiness were near ceiling in both groups, limiting the ability to detect enhancement. Collaboration network size increased over time to a comparable degree in both groups. Conclusions: The findings highlight the need for systematic intervention development research to identify efficacious strategies that can be implemented throughout the CTSA network to better support the goal of enhanced cross-disciplinary collaboration.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '14 December 2024'}, 'day': '14'}",29,2024

Existing studies examining designing for dissemination (D4D), a process that ensures interventions and implementation strategies consider adopters' contexts, have focused primarily on researchers, with limited perspectives of practitioners. To address these gaps, this study examined D4D practice among public health and clinical practitioners in the USA. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study among public health and primary care practitioners in April to June 2022 (analyzed in July 2022 to December 2022). Both groups were recruited through national-level rosters. The survey was informed by previous D4D studies and pretested using cognitive interviewing. Results: Among 577 respondents, 45% were public health and 55% primary care practitioners, with an overall survey response rate of 5.5%. The most commonly ranked sources of research evidence were email announcements for public health practitioners (43.7%) and reading academic journals for clinical practitioners (37.9%). Practitioners used research findings to promote health equity (67%) and evaluate programs/services (66%). A higher proportion of clinical compared to public health practitioners strongly agreed/agreed that within their work setting they had adequate financial resources (36% vs. 23%, p < 0.001) and adequate staffing (36% vs. 24%, p = 0.001) to implement research findings. Only 20% of all practitioners reported having a designated individual or team responsible for finding and disseminating research evidence. Conclusions: Addressing both individual and modifiable barriers, including organizational capacity to access and use research evidence, may better align the efforts of researchers with priorities and resources of practitioners.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '14 December 2024'}, 'day': '14'}",44,2024

Instead, if the parameters µ and p satisfy the opposite condition we have: (a) blow-up when the initial datum is large enough, (b) existence of global solutions when the initial datum is small enough. Hence our conditions on the parameters µ and p are optimal. We see that blow-up and global existence do not depend on the amplitude of the cone.

We construct a martingale solution using a modified Faedo-Galerkin’s method, following Brzeźniak et al (2019 Probab. Theory Relat. Fields 174 1273-338). Then by means of the Strichartz estimates deduced from Blair et al (2008 Proc. Am. Math. Soc. 136 247-56) but modified for our stochastic setting we show the pathwise uniqueness of solutions. Finally, we prove the existence of an invariant measure by means of a version of the Krylov-Bogoliubov method, which involves the weak topology, as proposed by Maslowski and Seidler (1999 Atti Accad. Naz. Lincei Cl. Sci. Fis. Mat. Natur. Rend. Lincei (9) Mat. Appl. 10 69-78). This is the first result of this type for stochastic nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS) on compact Riemannian manifolds without boundary and on relatively compact smooth domains even for an additive noise. Some remarks on the uniqueness in a particular case are provided as well.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '14 December 2024'}, 'day': '14'}",71,2024

There is a vast literature from the last 20 years that investigates this interacting dynamics under a graph theory formalism, namely as a graph endowed with an input-equivalence relation on the set of vertices that enables a characterisation of the admissible vector fields that rules the network dynamics. The present work goes in the direction of answering an inverse problem: for n ⩾ 2 , any mapping on R n can be realised as an admissible vector field for some graph with the number of vertices depending on (but not necessarily equal to) n. Given a mapping, we present a procedure to construct all non-equivalent admissible graphs, up to the appropriate equivalence relation. We also give an upper bound for the number of such graphs. As a consequence, invariant subspaces under the vector field can be investigated as the locus of synchrony states supported by an admissible graph, in the sense that a suitable graph can be chosen to realise couplings with more (or less) synchrony than another graph admissible to the same vector field. The approach provides in particular a systematic investigation of occurrence of chimera states in a network of van der Pol identical oscillators.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '14 December 2024'}, 'day': '14'}",24,2024

HfO2 and ZrO2 thin films deposited on fused silica substrates by pulsed laser deposition at various O2 pressures for defect and stoichiometry control were irradiated by Gaussian, ultrashort laser pulses (800 nm, 10 Hz, 70 fs) in a wide range of fluences. Both TC and LP collected signals were in good agreement with the existing theoretical description of laser–matter interaction at an ultrashort time scale. Our approach for an in situ LIDT monitoring system provides measurable signals for below-threshold irradiation conditions that indicate the endurance limit of the optical surfaces in the single-shot energy scanning mode. The LIDT value extracted from the LP-TC system is in line with the multipulse statistical analysis done with ISO 21254-2:2011(E).

Design: Cross-sectional analysis. Setting: Nationally representative sample of non-institutionalised adults in the USA. Participants: 79 686 adults from the National Health Interview Survey (2019–2021). Results: Marginal, low and very low food security were associated with increased prevalence odds of chronic pain (OR: 1·58 (95 % CI 1·44, 1·72), 2·28 (95 % CI 2·06, 2·52) and 3·37 (95 % CI 3·01, 3·78), respectively) and high-impact chronic pain (OR: 1·28 (95 % CI 1·14, 1·42), 1·55 (95 % CI 1·37, 1·75) and 1·90 (95 % CI 1·65, 2·18), respectively) in a dose–response fashion (P-trend < 0·0001 for both), adjusted for sociodemographic, socio-economic and clinically relevant factors.

Methods Overall, 1,119 patients from the Genetic Risk and Outcome in Psychosis (GROUP) study were included. Cognitive function, positive and negative symptoms were assessed at baseline, 3-year, and 6-year. Cardiometabolic biomarkers were measured at 3-year follow-up. We used linear and multinomial logistic regression models to test the association between cardiometabolic biomarkers and clinical trajectories and performed mediation analyzes, while adjusting for clinical and demographic confounders.

Methods Nationwide survey among French adults, recruited between March and April, 2022, using a quota method to capture a representative sample of the general population with regard to sex, age, socioeconomic status, size of the place of residence, and region. We included all participants who met the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of PCC in addition to a random sample of participants infected with SARS-COV-2 for at least 3 months but without PCC. Self-reported anxiety and depressive symptoms, chronic anxiety and depression (for more than 3 years), and anxiety and depression were measured using the GAD-2 and PHQ-2 questionnaires, respectively. Results In a sample of 1,095 participants with PCC and 1,021 participants infected with SARS-COV-2 without PCC, 21% had self-reported anxiety and 18% self-reported depression, whereas 33% and 20% had current measured symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively. The high prevalence of these symptoms cannot only be explained by the characterization of PCC, as only 13.4% of anxiety symptoms and 7.6% of depressive symptoms met the WHO criteria for PCC. Only one participant met the WHO criteria based on self-reported anxiety or depressive symptoms alone, as these were always combined with other symptoms in patients with PCC.

Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of European Psychiatric Association.Background Physical pain is a common issue in people with bipolar disorder (BD). It worsens mental health and quality of life, negatively impacts treatment response, and increases the risk of suicide. Lithium, which is prescribed in BD as a mood stabilizer, has shown promising effects on pain. Methods This naturalistic study included 760 subjects with BD (FACE-BD cohort) divided in two groups: with and without self-reported pain (evaluated with the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire). In this sample, 176 subjects were treated with lithium salts. The objectives of the study were to determine whether patients receiving lithium reported less pain, and whether this effect was associated with the recommended mood-stabilizing blood concentration of lithium. Results Subjects with lithium intake were less likely to report pain (odds ratio [OR] = 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35-0.95; p = 0.036) after controlling for sociodemographic variables, BD type, lifetime history of psychiatric disorders, suicide attempt, personality traits, current depression and anxiety levels, sleep quality, and psychomotor activity. Subjects taking lithium were even less likely to report pain when lithium concentration in blood was ≥0.5 mmol/l (OR = 0.45, 95% CI, 0.24-0.79; p = 0.008). Conclusions This is the first naturalistic study to show lithium's promising effect on pain in subjects suffering from BD after controlling for many confounding variables. This analgesic effect seems independent of BD severity and comorbid conditions. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the analgesic effect of lithium salts and to determine whether lithium decreases pain in other vulnerable populations.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '13 December 2024'}, 'day': '13'}",61,2024

To Parker, and many contemporary thinkers, organizational hierarchy is inherently destructive in any shape or form. It needs to be placed back into history, where it belongs. However, I challenge this idea by arguing that first, hierarchy should not be regarded as one single, homogeneous entity. It is contingent, and its quality (good or bad) too is contingent upon a variety of factors. Secondly, following insights from the “hermeneutic circle,” I propose that decent interpretations of organizing and leadership need to consider texts (and things) both in their entirety and in their parts.

All rights reserved.This article is concerned with the concept of postsecular rapprochement, which refers to the coming-together of secular and religious voices over mutual ethical concerns such as welfare, care, and solidarity. Although the concept provides a useful analytical instrument for capturing context-contingent transgressions of faith boundaries, we question some of the assumptions hidden in the way it has been employed so far. More specifically, we respond to geographers’ recent call for more sensitivity to “power relations and marginal experiences within practices of rapprochement.” We do so by turning the gaze toward historically non-incorporated religious welfare practices, in particular evangelical Christian solidarities in a Flemish urban welfare regime. Based on document analysis and in-depth interviews, we unpack a trajectory of postsecular rapprochement in a local cooperative network that connects a Flemish city council, a pluralistic umbrella organization, an evangelical Faith-Based Organization (FBO), and a Church of Christ. We propose to see this configuration as a “stretched” mode of postsecular rapprochement in which crossovers take place at different levels of interaction, thereby bridging faith and other divides. Capturing this mode, we conclude, brings us one step further in exploring the full scope of the phenomenon of postsecular rapprochement.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '12 December 2024'}, 'day': '12'}",34,2024

As such, policy makers have considered interfaith dialogue initiatives as an effective mechanism for promoting intergroup contact. However, little is understood about the factors that influence Australia’s two largest religious groups’—Christians and Muslims—attitudes toward interfaith dialogue. This paper focuses on Australia’s Uniting Church’s engagement in interfaith dialogue and explores the factors influencing their attitudes toward participating in interfaith dialogue with Australian Muslims. Employing a constructivist grounded theory methodology, the study, which involves everyday adherents as well as religious leaders, highlights a multitude of positive and negative drivers. These include fear of the unknown, a lack of relational proximity, and a diminished congregational confidence to engage in non-traditional practices.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '12 December 2024'}, 'day': '12'}",39,2024

The aim of this study is to assess the rate of postoperative SSIs between total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) and total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH). Can the rate of SSI be reduced with the use of a laparoscopic mode of hysterectomy over abdominal? Materials and Methods: It was a retrospective comparative study. The study was conducted in the obstetrics and gynecology department at a tertiary care center from June 2016 to March 2020. A total of 300 patients who underwent hysterectomy either via laparoscopic or abdominal route were included in the study. They were subdivided into two groups: a total of 167 underwent TLH (Group 1) and 133 had TAH (Group 2). The results were compared. It included the age and body mass index of the patient, indication of surgery, size of the uterus, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative SSIs, duration of hospital stay, and readmission rates. Results: It was found a high rate of SSI in TAH (82.4% vs. 17.6%, P < 0.001, Cramer's V-0.18), the operative time taken (75 ± 25 min vs. 128 ± 52 min, P < 0.001), and the mean blood loss during TLH (110 ± 30 ml vs. 160 ± 116 ml, P < 0.001) was found significant for patients. The hospital stay after TLH was found to be significantly shorter (4 ± 2.47 days vs. 7 ± 2.43, P < 0.001). Conclusion: TLH has improved the psychological, physical, and financial burden on the health care department. Thus, it has proved a preferred route over TAH.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '11'}",23,2024

We present the case of a 27-year-old primigravida with rheumatic heart disease and a history of mitral valve replacement on anticoagulants who experienced recurrent episodes of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Despite conservative management and adjustments to anticoagulant therapy, the bleeding persisted. Further investigations revealed a small pseudoaneurysm originating from the left uterine artery. Bilateral uterine artery embolization (UAE) using polyvinyl alcohol particles was successfully performed. The patient's condition improved, and she was discharged on a carefully regulated medication regimen. This case highlights the importance of considering rare causes of PPH in high-risk patients, such as uterine artery pseudoaneurysm. Anticoagulants could be a potential contributor of its spontaneous rupture.

All rights reserved.Introduction: The model, proposed by Federico Tobar, for the comparison between health systems mentions the review of three different dimensions: health policies, epidemiological situation, and health system, to delve into similarities and differences that exist between systems from several countries. Proposal: The health systems of Mexico and Colombia share characteristics and reforms that make them similar, however, an analysis framework is required to make a structured comparison. Argument: The reforms in the health policies of Mexico and Colombia generated a fragmented health system that serves different types of populations, in the case of Mexico it is based on social security, and in Colombia on structured pluralism or regulated market; in both cases, it has not been possible to reverse this situation. The health situation in both countries is similar, dominated by a decrease in infectious diseases and an increase in chronic-degenerative diseases, as well as the appearance of health social problems (like homicides). Finally, there are multiple components in both health systems. This generates a scenario with several subsystems in the case of Mexico and different actors in Colombia. Conclusion: Both health systems are fragmented, with policies that try to increase their coverage. They have comparable epidemiological profiles, which suggests that they face related needs within the health system itself. A pending issue for both is the equity in the services which has been unequal.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'January-June 2024', 'day': '11'}",47,2024

Both low and high concentrations of 5-HT in the body are associated with several neurological disorders. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop fast, accurate, reliable, and cost-effective disposable sensors for 5-HT detection. Herein, we report the sensing of 5-HT using a disposable paper-based electrode (PPE) modified with a ternary nanocomposite comprising poly(pyrrole) (P(py)), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), and iron oxide (Fe2O3). The sensor material was well characterized in terms of its structural, morphological, and chemical attributes using electron microscopy, spectral techniques, and electrochemical studies to prove the robust formation of the electroactive ternary nanocomposite and its suitability for 5-HT detection. The developed sensor exhibited an impressive limit of detection (LOD) of 22 nM with a wide linear range of 0.01 to 500 μM, which falls in the recommended clinically relevant range. The analytical recovery, spike sample analysis, and interference studies with ascorbic acid (AA), uric acid (UA), and epinephrine (E) showed satisfactory results, wherein the sensor could detect simultaneously both 5-HT and dopamine (DA). The potential practical utility of the developed sensor was further assessed by quantifying the concentration of 5-HT in the brain samples of Drosophila melanogaster, a versatile genetic model organism employed for modeling different neural disorders in humans, and validated by gold-standard HPLC-UV experiments. The as-fabricated single-run disposable sensor with a ternary nanocomposite exhibits excellent stability with good reproducibility and is a promising platform for identifying clinically relevant concentrations of 5-HT.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '11 December 2024'}, 'day': '11'}",67,2024

To address the training and employment needs of clinical research coordinators (CRCs), one of the largest sectors of the CRP workforce, we designed, developed, and implemented an online career navigation system, eMPACTTM (eMpowering Purposeful Advancement of Careers and Training). Methods: A design-based research method was employed as an overarching approach that frames iterative design, development, and implementation of educational interventions. The five major phases of this project - conceptualization, task analysis for measurement development, algorithms development, algorithms validation, and system evaluation - presented specific goals and relevant methods. Results: The results reported how the eMPACTTM system was conceptualized, developed, and validated. The system allowed CRCs to navigate tailored training and job opportunities by completing their task competencies and career goals. The data sets could, in turn, support employees' and training coordinators' informed decisions about organizational training needs and recruitment. The early dissemination results showed steady growth in registered CRCs and diversity in users' ethnicity and job levels. Conclusions: The eMPACTTM service showed the possibility of supporting CRCs' individual career advancement and organizational workforce enhancement and diversity. Long-term research is needed to evaluate its impact on CRC workforce development, explore key factors influencing workforce sustainability, and expand eMPACTTM service to other CRP sectors.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '11 December 2024'}, 'day': '11'}",40,2024

Published by Cambridge University Press.As homicide rates spike across the United States, researchers nominate diverse causes such as temperature, city greenness, structural racism, inequality, poverty and more. While variation in homicide rates clearly results from multiple causes, many correlation studies lack the systematic theory needed to identify the underlying factors that structure individual motivations. Building on pioneering work in evolutionary human sciences, we propose that when resources are unequally distributed, individuals may have incentives to undertake high-risk activities, including lethal violence, in order to secure material and social capital. Here we evaluate this theory by analysing federal data on homicide rates, poverty and income inequality across all 50 US states for the years 1990, 2000 and 2005-2020. Supporting predictions derived from evolutionary social sciences, we find that the interaction of poverty (scarcity) and inequality (unequal distribution) best explains variation in US homicide rates. Results suggest that the increase in homicide rates during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic are driven in part by these same underlying causes that structure homicide rates across the US over the last 30 years. We suggest that these results provide compelling evidence to expand strategies for reducing homicide rates by dismantling structures that generate and concentrate sustained poverty and economic inequality.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '11 December 2024'}, 'day': '11'}",52,2024

With the primary catalogue, we also provide two auxiliary catalogues. The first is a fixed-resolution, 25-arcsec catalogue approximately matching the sky coverage of the RACS-low catalogue. This 25-arcsec catalogue is constructed identically to the primary catalogue, except images are convolved to a less-sensitive 25-arcsec angular resolution. The second auxiliary catalogue is designed for time-domain science and is the concatenation of source lists from the original RACS-mid images with no additional convolution, mosaicking, or de-duplication of source entries to avoid losing time-variable signals.

The book is written from Rani Jindan Kaur’s perspective who was the last wife of Maharaja Ranjit Singh and the last regent queen of the Sikh Empire to reclaim her lost identity. This analysis begins with a brief description of Sikh empire and its glorious past with a special focus on a woman who equally contributed and shaped it. It then traces how historians have always been partial towards women for not giving them enough space in the annals of history. This underrepresentation was the systematic erasure as not only were they punished for stepping outside the limited roles off ered to them but if they achieve great things they were often ignored or forced to submit to the prevailing gender norms of their times. It then focuses on how Chit ra Banerjee Divakaruni has used the erasure of women representation in history as a winning chance to rewrite the lost world of Rani Jindan that is not much talked about in historical documents.

Arriving thereby in the Center Poetically",International Journal of Religion,"[('Najran University', 'Najran', 'Saudi Arabia')]","© 2024, Transnational Press London Ltd. All rights reserved.References to intertextuality in the collection of poetry (Diwan) by ""Hassan ibn Batnnin"". Arriving thereby in the center poetically. This Diwan is one of the contemporary poetic publications that bears a title that refers to explicit intertextuality. In addition, when it was ""standing on the reality of textual interaction in its recovery or simulation from previous texts on it."" (1) It is natural for us to find that the author has counted the references from which he draws his text, especially since he has titled the Diwan with a clear Quranic reference. The intended meaning of the references is the source through which the creator shapes the corresponding model, ""where the citation of the text is,"" that is, the methods people use to benefit from famous texts, or to refer to them. (2) Literary texts vary in their relative popularity and people's knowledge of them. This variation exists in different directions and fields. Based on this diversity, the references for the texts that creators promote, discuss, and engage with can be literary, religious or historical, and perhaps culture or language is the reference of the creative in that. And this is the ""factors that make the exploitation of a text dependent on knowing a previous text more than the texts it knows in the future, as understanding the text sometimes requires establishing a bridge between this text and other texts."" And similarly, a loop from the sociability, and it can be said that the interactions that occur between texts arise through the extent of agreement of the text that is being created with other previous visions. Therefore, he will try to search, analyze, and present examples from the Arriving thereby in the center collectively, a desire to reach models that employ the association mentioned by the poet in his Divan, and to know the references and sources on which the poet relied in employing this mechanism. The importance of research:-The absence of any specialized study in this Diwan; because it is one of the latest works in contemporary poetry.-The content of the Diwan that the poet refers to through this title.-The explicit Quranic intertextuality in the title; it invites to read the Diwan and explore its contents. Problem of research and questions: The Diwan (Arriving thereby in the center poetically) has been printed with a somewhat mysterious title, and with this mystery, there is a direct reference to the Quranic text, which invites reading this work and examining the printing of its verses, its meanings, and its references. The research will attempt to discuss that by answering a set of questions: 1. Who is Hassan ibn Batnnin and what are the most important characteristics of his poetry? 2. What is meant by intertextuality and what are its main references? 3. What are the intertextual references employed by the poet in his Diwan? 4. How closely does the poet relate to the Quranic text and invoke it? 5. What are the reasons and consequences of the presence of intertextuality in the Diwan (Arriving thereby in the center poetically), and what are the implications of this intertextuality in it? Research objectives: 1. To identify the translation of the poet Hassan bin Batnnin, and to understand the most important features of his poetry. 2. Introduction to intertextual references and highlighting the most prominent ones. 3. Statement of the intertextual references employed by the poet in his collection for analysis. 4. The poet's alignment with the Quranic text and his invocation of it in his poetry. 5. Studying the reasons and consequences of the presence of intertextuality in the Diwan ""Arriving thereby in the center poetically"" and its implications. Research Methodology: The nature of intertextuality requires that it enters into its study more than a method, whether it be structural, deconstructive, semiotic, or semantic, which enables me to read the collection in general and understand intertextuality in particular. Research plan: Introduction and covers: (Importance of the topic-Questions-Objectives-Method-Plan…)-Translation of the poet and understanding the characteristics of his poetry.-Introduction to the Diwan (Arriving thereby in the center poetically).-Definition of intertextuality, its concept and its signs.-References to intertextuality.

Many parties have exploited the opportunities available within the social media application like education, business, networking engagement and much more. Like in business, social media seems to be a must platform for every business venture and has even been seen as the quickie way to start a business. The question is, do these so-called online business owners possess any specific entrepreneurial characteristics which influence their business performance? Or does it matter to possess specific entrepreneurial characteristics to excel in online business? Thus, this paper is to undergo a study to see if entrepreneurial orientation does have an impact on social media adoption and business performance among Bumiputera micro-entrepreneurs. This study is trying to integrate UTAUT theory and resource-based-view theory to evaluate how social media adoption may impact the business performance among the Bumiputera micro-entrepreneurs.

All rights reserved.BACKGROUND: Vertigo is closely related to clinical neurological disorders. When neurons are damaged or dead, it may lead to abnormalities in the vestibular system and trigger vertigo symptoms. Therefore, it is necessary to explore and analyze the hotspots related to vertigo that are common in clinical neurology. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the vertigo-related histopathological changes in clinical neurology and the research hotspots worldwide using bibliometric methods. METHODS: The WanFang database and Web of Science core set database were searched by the first author to retrieve the research-related literature published from 2014-2023 on the treatment of common vertigo in clinical neurology. A bibliometric analysis of the number of publications, country/region, institution, keywords, co-cited literature, and highly cited literature was peformed using VOSviewer_1.6.19 software to summarize the research hotspots in this research field. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Web of Science core set database had the highest number of 174 publications in this field in 2022, and WanFang database had the highest number of 133 publications in this field in 2020. The top 3 countries with the highest number of publications are the United States, Germany, and China. The University of Munich, Germany is the international institution with the highest number of publications in this field, while Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine is the Chinese institution with the highest number of publications in this field. The results of keyword analysis showed that the research hotspot diseases in this field in China are mainly Meniere’s disease, cervical vertigo, senile vertigo, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, isolated vertigo, and hypertensive vertigo, and the treatments include acupuncture, rehabilitation, medication (gastrodin, Banxia Baizhu Tianma Tang), and manipulative reduction. International research hotspot diseases in this field mainly include benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular disorders in new coronavirus cases, Meniere’s disease, vestibular schwannoma, acoustic neuromas, and vestibular migraines, etc., and the hotspot treatments are antivertiginous medications, antidepressant and anxiolytic treatments, and microsurgery. The results of literature co-citation analysis showed that for acute vestibular syndrome with persistent vertigo as the main symptom, three-step bedside ophthalmoscopy (HINTS: Head-Impact-Nystagmus-Strabismus Test) is more sensitive than early MRI in the diagnosis of combined strokes in patients with acute vestibular syndrome, which is the most peer-recognized method of detecting strokes in vestibular syndrome, whereas hormonal therapy is more effective to treat vestibular neuritis patients with paroxysmal vertigo as the main symptom. The results of highly cited literature analysis showed that, in the hot literature included in WanFang database in the past 10 years, acupuncture at Fengchi point and the acupuncture method of inducing resuscitation to improve posterior circulation ischemic vertigo have achieved certain results. The literature published in the past 3 years has indicated that Ginkgo biloba leaf extract+gastrodin, acupuncture+Banxia Baizhu Tang, betahistine+gastrodin, vestibular rehabilitation training+Epley Maneuver, all can improve the vertigo symptoms to different degrees. While there were no featured anti-vertigo drugs indicated in the literature in the Web of Science core set data in the recent 10 years, and most of them are based on traditional anti-vertigo drugs and microsurgery. However, there are a few case reports in the international literature in the last 3 years that found that COVID-19 infection may lead to vestibular neuritis and vertigo symptoms. The onset and progression of vertigo may be closely related to neuronal damage and regeneration. For example, viral infections, inflammatory stimuli, or other pathologic factors may lead to neuronal damage or death, thereby affecting the function of the vestibular system. Vertigo-related diagnosis and treatment standardization guidelines have been published both domestically and internationally. Currently, international guidelines recommend the combination of vestibular rehabilitation and physical rehabilitation for the treatment of vertigo, and Chinese guidelines recommend the combination of Chinese and Western medicine, reduction and acupuncture. However, the level of evidence is not very high, so a large number of large-sample, multicenter randomized controlled trials on anti-vertigo treatment are needed in the future.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '8 December 2024'}, 'day': '08'}",34,2024

Materials and Methods: In this retrospective comparative study, we reviewed all hysterectomies performed in the Al-Karak Governmental Hospital in Al-Karak, Jordan, from September 2018 to July 2022. We enrolled 129 patients who underwent hysterectomy. The patients were divided into the TLH (n = 39) and TAH (n = 90) groups. Patient data were accessed through hospital records and analyzed using SPSS 25.0. Results: The most common indication for TLH was uterine fibroid, and that for TAH was abnormal uterine bleeding, although the specimen weights were comparable. There was no significant between-group difference in the patient's demographics. Although the TLH group had longer operative time, the hospital stay was shorter and there were no reported cases of wound infection. The estimated blood loss was significantly lower in the TLH group than in the TAH group, but there was no difference between the two groups in terms of blood transfusion requirement and postoperative hemoglobin level. Conclusion: TLH and TAH had comparable overall outcomes in the Al-Karak Governmental Hospital. However, TLH was superior to TAH in terms of blood loss, and patients with TLH recovered faster without postoperative wound infection.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '07'}",21,2024

Materials and Methods: Perioperative data, including operative time, estimated blood loss, and complications, were retrospectively analyzed in 731 patients with gynecologic malignancies who underwent transperitoneal PLND, including 460 and 271 in the CLS and RAS groups, respectively. Data were statistically analyzed using the Chi-square test or Student's t-test as appropriate. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The mean age was 50 ± 14 years and 53 ± 13 years in the RAS and CLS groups (P < 0.01), respectively. The mean body mass index was 23.4 ± 4.8 kg/m 2 and 22.4 ± 3.6 kg/m 2 in the RAS group and CLS groups (P < 0.01), respectively. The operative time, blood loss, and number of resected lymph nodes were 52 ± 15 min, 110 ± 88 mL, and 45 ± 17, respectively, in the RAS group and 46 ± 15 min, 89 ± 78 mL, and 38 ± 16, respectively, in the CLS group (all P < 0.01). The rate of Clavien-Dindo Grade ≥ III complications was 6.3% and 8.7% in the RAS and CLS groups, respectively (P = 0.17). Conclusion: Shorter operative time and lower blood loss are achieved when PLND for gynecologic malignancies is performed through CLS rather than RAS. However, RAS results in the resection of a greater number of pelvic lymph nodes.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '07'}",42,2024

For young patients with cervical cancer who desire to get pregnant and whose lesion is confined to the cervix, sparing the uterus and, partially, the cervix should be prioritized as much as possible, while simultaneously ensuring favorable oncologic outcomes. In this review, we explore how to choose an adequate fertility-preserving procedure to achieve a balance between favorable oncologic outcomes and fertility and management during pregnancy after a radical trachelectomy in women with early-stage cervical cancer. For patients who require hysterectomy or radiation, evaluation of the ovarian condition and laparoscopic ovarian transposition followed by the use of artificial reproduction techniques and pregnancy by surrogacy should be discussed as options to achieve a successful pregnancy.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '07'}",31,2024

Karger AG, Basel. Introduction: Over the last decade, the emergence and spread of personalized medicine (PM) have defined a substantial revolution in healthcare. In principle, healthcare system sustainability is challenged by the investments required for research and development, as well as the adoption of PM techniques in routine clinical care. The ""Integrating China in the International Consortium for Personalized Medicine""(IC2PerMed) EU-funded project aims to integrate China into the ""International Consortium for Personalized Medicine""(ICPerMed). IC2PerMed aims to align the EU and China's research agendas in this field to enable a swift development of approaches in the EU and China with strong leverage upon EU-Chinese collaborations. Methods: Within this project, we first mapped relevant policies on PM in both the EU and China, and then we involved European and Chinese experts in PM in workshops and Delphi surveys in order to identify relevant priorities for the implementation of PM in sustainable healthcare. Results: As a result of this process, we identified nine overarching priorities, each addressing specific aspects of the sustainability of healthcare systems and PM implementation, with the main goal of supporting policymakers in integrating PM approaches in the EU and China. Discussion/conclusion: The implementation of PM in health systems is appealing in terms of improved accuracy in diagnostics, treatment, and prevention of disease, as well as reduction of the side effects resulting from inefficient use of drugs. Research, development, and implementation of needed techniques require time and resources that can slow the adoption of PM in healthcare systems. The nine priorities we identified address some of the most critical points, trying to lay the foundations for a comprehensive approach.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '7 December 2024'}, 'day': '07'}",63,2024

Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Nutrition Society.Objective: Children’s exposure to unhealthy food marketing contributes to poor diets by influencing the foods that children like, request, buy and consume. This study aimed to use confirmatory mediational analyses to test a hypothetical model of marketing effects, to better understand the mechanisms behind food marketing’s impacts on children. Design: Children responded to a cross-sectional online survey about their attitudes towards, and purchase and consumption behaviours of, ten frequently promoted food/beverage brands and their media use. Structural equation modelling tested a priori potential pathways for the effects of food marketing exposure on children’s diets. Participants: 10–16-year-old children (n 400). Setting: Australia. Results: There was a significant positive correlation between children’s commercial screen media use and their attitudes towards brands (related to perceived social norms) and their brand purchasing behaviours, including their own purchases and requests to parents. The use of strategies to avoid advertising in commercial screen media reduced but did not remove the association between media use and brand purchases. Other brand exposures (on clothing, outdoor advertising, sponsorships) had a positive association with children’s perceived social norms about brands and their brand purchases and requests. Non-commercial screen media use was not associated with any brand-related outcomes. Conclusions: Commercial screen media use and other brand exposures were strongly positively associated with children’s perceptions and purchasing behaviours of frequently marketed food/beverages. Regulations to restrict children’s exposures to food marketing on-screen and through other media are required to reduce the effect of marketing exposure on children’s food purchasing behaviours.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '7 December 2024'}, 'day': '07'}",41,2024

Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Association for Clinical and Translational Science.Introduction: Integrating social and environmental determinants of health (SEDoH) into enterprise-wide clinical workflows and decision-making is one of the most important and challenging aspects of improving health equity. We engaged domain experts to develop a SEDoH informatics maturity model (SIMM) to help guide organizations to address technical, operational, and policy gaps. Methods: We established a core expert group consisting of developers, informaticists, and subject matter experts to identify different SIMM domains and define maturity levels. The candidate model (v0.9) was evaluated by 15 informaticists at a Center for Data to Health community meeting. After incorporating feedback, a second evaluation round for v1.0 collected feedback and self-assessments from 35 respondents from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative, the Center for Leading Innovation and Collaboration's Informatics Enterprise Committee, and a publicly available online self-assessment tool. Results: We developed a SIMM comprising seven maturity levels across five domains: data collection policies, data collection methods and technologies, technology platforms for analysis and visualization, analytics capacity, and operational and strategic impact. The evaluation demonstrated relatively high maturity in analytics and technological capacity, but more moderate maturity in operational and strategic impact among academic medical centers. Changes made to the tool in between rounds improved its ability to discriminate between intermediate maturity levels.

Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Association for Clinical and Translational Science.Introduction: This study aimed to map the maturity of precision oncology as an example of a Learning Health System by understanding the current state of practice, tools and informatics, and barriers and facilitators of maturity. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 34 professionals (e.g., clinicians, pathologists, and program managers) involved in Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs). Interviewees were recruited through outreach at 3 large academic medical centers (AMCs) (n = 16) and a Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) company (n = 18). Interviewees were asked about their roles and relationships with MTBs, processes and tools used, and institutional practices. The interviews were then coded and analyzed to understand the variation in maturity across the evolving field of precision oncology. Results: The findings provide insight into the present level of maturity in the precision oncology field, including the state of tooling and informatics within the same domain, the effects of the critical environment on overall maturity, and prospective approaches to enhance maturity of the field. We found that maturity is relatively low, but continuing to evolve, across these dimensions due to the resource-intensive and complex sociotechnical infrastructure required to advance maturity of the field and to fully close learning loops. Conclusion: Our findings advance the field by defining and contextualizing the current state of maturity and potential future strategies for advancing precision oncology, providing a framework to examine how learning health systems mature, and furthering the development of maturity models with new evidence.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '7 December 2024'}, 'day': '07'}",20,2024

Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health, Inc.Objective: Around the world, pandemics have been considered among the main hazards in the last 2 decades. Hospitals are 1 of the most important organizations responding to pandemics. The aim of this study was to design and develop a valid checklist for evaluating the hospitals' performance in response to COVID-19 pandemic, for the first time. Methods: This study is a mixed method research design that began in February, 2020 and was conducted in 3 phases: Designing a conceptual model, designing a primary checklist structure, and checklist psychometric evaluation. Known-groups method has been used to evaluate construct validity. Two groups of hospitals were compared: group A (COVID-19 Hospitals) and group B (the other hospitals). Results: The checklist's main structure was designed with 6 main domains, 23 sub-domains, and 152 items. The content validity ratio and index were 0.94 and 0.79 respectively. Eleven items were added, 106 items were removed, and 40 items were edited. Independent t-test showed a significant difference between the scores of the 2 groups of hospitals (P < 0.0001). Pearson correlation coefficient test also showed a high correlation between our checklist and the other. The internal consistency of the checklist was 0.98 according to Cronbach's alpha test. Conclusions: Evaluating the hospitals' performance and identifying their strengths and weaknesses, can help health system policymakers and hospital managers, and leads to improved performance in response to COVID-19.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '7 December 2024'}, 'day': '07'}",49,2024

Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Association for Clinical and Translational Science.Background: Bayesian statistical approaches are extensively used in new statistical methods but have not been adopted at the same rate in clinical and translational (C&T) research. The goal of this paper is to accelerate the transition of new methods into practice by improving the C&T researcher's ability to gain confidence in interpreting and implementing Bayesian analyses. Methods: We developed a Bayesian data analysis plan and implemented that plan for a two-arm clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of a new opioid in reducing time to discharge from the post-operative anesthesia unit and nerve block usage in surgery. Through this application, we offer a brief tutorial on Bayesian methods and exhibit how to apply four Bayesian statistical packages from STATA, SAS, and RStan to conduct linear and logistic regression analyses in clinical research. Results: The analysis results in our application were robust to statistical package and consistent across a wide range of prior distributions. STATA was the most approachable package for linear regression but was more limited in the models that could be fitted and easily summarized. SAS and R offered more straightforward documentation and data management for the posteriors. They also offered direct programming of the likelihood making them more easily extendable to complex problems. Conclusion: Bayesian analysis is now accessible to a broad range of data analysts and should be considered in more C&T research analyses. This will allow C&T research teams the ability to adopt and interpret Bayesian methodology in more complex problems where Bayesian approaches are often needed.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '7 December 2024'}, 'day': '07'}",46,2024

Conventional TiO2 ETL preparation methods require high-temperature annealing (>450 °C), which increases the fabrication cost and limits application on flexible substrates. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a method for fabricating thin TiO2 films via sputtering at room temperature without thermal annealing. We systematically investigated the effects of the sputtering parameters, ultraviolet (UV) treatment, and thermal sintering on the properties of TiO2 ETLs for PSCs. With proper UV treatment, the sputtered TiO2 films exhibited well-matched band alignment, defect reduction, and improvements in the carrier concentration, electron mobility, and hole-blocking ability compared with thermally sintered TiO2 films. We also fabricated large-area perovskite modules using sputtered and UV-treated TiO2 films as ETLs on rigid and flexible substrates, and they had maximum power-conversion efficiencies of 18.82% and 14.61%, respectively. This study provides a simple, low-temperature route for fabricating ETLs for flexible perovskite solar modules.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '07'}",53,2024

This conversion can impact uniform compression and increase the risk of damage to optics. However, the dispersive grating used in the smoothing by spectral dispersion technology will introduce a temporal delay and can spatially smooth the target. The combined effect of the dispersive grating and the focusing lens is equivalent to a Gaussian low-pass filter, which is equivalent to 8 GHz bandwidth and can reduce the intensity modulation on the target to below 5% with 0.3 nm @ 3 GHz + 20 GHz spectrum phase modulation.

Published by Cambridge University Press on behalf of The Nutrition Society.Objective: To investigate the association between a lifestyle score and all-cause mortality in the Chilean population. Design: Prospective study. Settings: The score was based on seven modifiable behaviours: salt intake, fruit and vegetable intake, alcohol consumption, sleep duration, smoking, physical activity and sedentary behaviours. 1-point was assigned for each healthy recommendation. Points were summed to create an unweighted score from 0 (less healthy) to 7 (healthiest). According to their score, participants were then classified into: less healthy (0–2 points), moderately healthy (3–4 points) and the healthiest (5–7 points). Associations between the categories of lifestyle score and all-cause mortality were investigated using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for confounders. Nonlinear associations were also investigated. Participants: 2706 participants from the Chilean National Health Survey 2009–2010. Results: After a median follow-up of 10·9 years, 286 (10·6 %) participants died. In the maximally adjusted model, and compared with the healthiest participants, those less healthy had 2·55 (95 % CI 1·75, 3·71) times higher mortality risk due to any cause. Similar trends were identified for the moderately healthy group. Moreover, there was a significant trend towards increasing the mortality risk when increasing unhealthy behaviours (hazard ratio model 3: 1·61 (95 % CI 1·34, 1·94)). There was no evidence of nonlinearity between the lifestyle score and all-cause mortality. Conclusion: Individuals in the less healthy lifestyle category had higher mortality risk than the healthiest group. Therefore, public health strategies should be implemented to promote adherence to a healthy lifestyle across the Chilean population.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '6 December 2024'}, 'day': '06'}",50,2024

All rights reserved.Background & Objective: Selective high-risk screening of children suspected of having inherited metabolic disorders was conducted jointly by Chemical Pathology section and the Pediatric Department of Indus Hospital and Health Network-(IHHN) from October 2020-March 2022. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS) for newborn screening was recently introduced in a local laboratory. We did a selective high screening of children for metabolic disorders by using MS for neonates and other relevant tests for older children in our hospital. The present study was undertaken to get an estimate of the number of metabolic cases screened and identified after inclusion of an extended workup. Methods: This is a retrospective chart review of children who were selectively screened for IMDs. Patients’ records with ages ranging from birth to fourteen years of age were retrieved from the electronic records department of IHHN from October 2020 to March 2022. Records were searched for demographic data, history, signs, symptoms, and lab investigations. All relevant information was recorded on a pre-designed questionnaire. Results: A total of 178 children were screened for inherited metabolic disorders. Majority of the children screened were less than one month of age 96 (54%). Consanguinity was noted in 74 (41.5%) children. Most common symptoms observed were failure to thrive in 77 children (43%), hypoglycemia in 45 children (25%), and feeding difficulty in 36 children (20%). Inherited metabolic disorders were confirmed in 12 children out of which five had congenital adrenal hyperplasia, four had cystic fibrosis and three children had congenital hypothyroidism. Conclusion: In the present study, we were able to screen several children after inclusion of an extended metabolic workup. However, confirmation of many disorders like fatty acid oxidation defects, disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, and sphingolipidosis could not be done due to lack of confirmatory tests. We recommend that confirmatory tests of these disorders be included in local labs.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '5 December 2024'}, 'day': '05'}",22,2024

Here we probe the less studied inertial chiral matter with spinners on an air table. We show here the emergence of high levels of spin for a minority of (+) handed spinners in the presence of a majority of (−) handed spinners (vice versa). This deep violation of equipartition occurs due to the inertial (memory preserving) nature of elastic collisions between underdamped translating and rotating objects. Underdamped spinners of the same spin sign annihilate their spins when they elastically collide, transferring their spin angular momentum into orbital angular momentum, while oppositely handed spinners tend to preserve their individual spin levels, leading to the pumping of minority spinners to high spin levels. Entropy production and the flow of entropy in this underdamped system are also counter-intuitive, showing dramatic oscillations in time.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",46,2024

Using a Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) behavior change theory framework, the intervention provides patients detailed information in order to improve patient control over exercise and dietary behaviors. In addition to standard care, the intervention group received DialBetesPlus, a self-management support system allowing patients to monitor exercise, blood glucose, diet, blood pressure, and body weight via a smartphone application. The primary outcome, change in UACR after 12 months (used as a surrogate measure of renal function), was 28.8% better than the control group’s change (P = 0.029). Secondary outcomes also improved in the intervention group, including a 0.32-point better change in HbA1c percentage (P = 0.041). These improvements persisted when models were adjusted to account for the impacts of coadministration of drugs targeting albuminuria (GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT-2 inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, and ARBs) (UACR: −32.3% [95% CI: −49.2%, −9.8%] between-group difference in change, P = 0.008). Exploratory multivariate regression analysis suggests that the improvements were primarily due to levels of exercise. This is the first trial to show that a lifestyle intervention via mHealth achieved a clinically-significant improvement in moderately increased albuminuria.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",61,2024

Due to highly-stochastic transcriptomics data, accurate detection of cell types is still challenged, especially for RNA-sequencing data from human beings. In this case, deep neural networks have been increasingly employed to mine cell type specific patterns and have outperformed statistic approaches in cell clustering. Results: Using cross-correlation to capture gene–gene interactions, this study proposes the scCompressSA method to integrate topological patterns from scRNA-seq data, with support of self-attention (SA) based coefficient compression (CC) block. This SA-based CC block is able to extract and employ static gene–gene interactions from scRNA-seq data. This proposed scCompressSA method has enhanced clustering accuracy in multiple benchmark scRNA-seq datasets by integrating topological and temporal features.

Oxidative stress is one of the most well-known damage mechanisms for both. However, studies on the association with induced 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in Iran are scarce, with no study on the interactive effect of As exposure and smoking in the literature. Objective: This stratified cross-sectional study aimed to assess urinary and serum 8-OHdG levels in the relation to As exposure from drinking water, smoking and their interaction effect. Methods: This study was based on 132 healthy male subjects living in villages of Hashtroud County, Iran (2021). All participants were categorized into four groups: (i) non-As exposed, never smokers (n = 33); (ii) non-As exposed, active smokers (n = 33); (iii) As exposed, never smokers (n = 33); and (iv) As exposed, active smokers (n = 33). Data on demographic and lifestyle factors were collected, and urinary and serum levels of 8-OHdG were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The smoker's daily cigarette consumption and the duration of smoking were self-reported data. Results: Participants consuming drinking water with an As concentration > 10 µg/L had significantly higher urinary total arsenic (U-tAs) concentrations (median 26.96, IQR 21.35–37.17) µg/g Cr compared to the reference group (median 19.33, IQR 17.29–23.26) µg/g Cr. There was a significant difference in the serum concentration of 8-OHdG between groups (i) and (iii), (iv) and also between groups (ii) and (iv). We did not find a significant interaction effect of As exposure and smoking on the both urinary and serum 8-OHdG levels (P > 0.05).

Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group, on behalf of Shanghai Shangyixun Cultural Communication Co., Ltd.Globally, hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections are prevalent. The finding of high viral loads and persistent viral shedding in ejaculate suggests that HEV replicates within the human male genital tract, but its target organ is unknown and appropriate models are lacking. We aimed to determine the HEV tropism in the human testis and its potential influence on male reproductive health. We conducted an ex vivo culture of human testis explants and in vitro culture of primary human Sertoli cells. Clinically derived HEV genotype 1 (HEV1) and HEV3 virions, as well as rat-derived HEV-C1, were used for inoculation. Transcriptomic analysis was performed on testis tissues collected from tacrolimus-treated rabbits with chronic HEV3 infection. Our findings reveal that HEV3, but not HEV1 or HEV-C1, can replicate in human testis explants and primary human Sertoli cells. Tacrolimus treatment significantly enhanced the replication efficiency of HEV3 in testis explants and enabled successful HEV1 infection in Sertoli cells. HEV3 infection disrupted the secretion of several soluble factors and altered the cytokine microenvironment within primary human Sertoli cells. Finally, intratesticular transcriptomic analysis of immunocompromised rabbits with chronic HEV infection indicated downregulation of genes associated with spermatogenesis. HEV can infect the human testicular tissues and Sertoli cells, with increased replication efficiency when exposed to tacrolimus treatment. These findings shed light on how HEV may persist in the ejaculate of patients with chronic hepatitis E and provide valuable ex vivo tools for studying countermeasures.","{'year': '2024', 'date-text': {'@xfab-added': 'true', '$': '2024'}}",39,2024

Although the manipulation of OAM based on metasurfaces has brought about great achievements in various fields, such manipulation currently remains at single-DoF level, which means the multiplexed manipulation of OAM with other optical DoFs is still lacking, greatly hampering the application of OAM beams and advancement of metasurfaces. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose the idea of multiplexed coherent pixel (MCP) for metasurfaces. This approach enables the manipulation of arbitrary complex-amplitude under incident lights of both plane and OAM waves, on the basis of which we have realized the multiplexed DoF control of OAM and wavelength. As a result, the MCP method expands the types of incident lights which can be simultaneously responded by metasurfaces, enriches the information processing capability of metasurfaces, and creates applications of information encryption and OAM demultiplexer.

Methods: Male recreational half-marathon runners in Zhejiang Province, China were recruited. A set of literature-based and panel-reviewed questionnaires were used to assess the epidemiological conditions of the recruited runners. Descriptive and binary regression analyses were done for the profiling and identification of predictors related to higher half-marathon performance (completing time ≤ 105 min). Participants were assigned to the training set (n = 141) and the testing set (n = 61) randomly.

Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science', 'Binghamton', 'United States')]","© The Author(s) 2024.The Internet of Things (IoT) devices are pervasively deployed and embedded into our daily lives. Over several years, the massive assimilation of IoT devices has given rise to smart cities, smart factories, smart farms, etc. While IoTs can collect immense amounts of user and environmental information, the lack of adequate security measures is among the major concerns about information security and privacy. With the ever-increasing presence of IoTs, information flow between IoT devices in a single or multi-layered network is becoming increasingly vulnerable to attacks. Although several software-based solutions have been developed over the years that improve the security of resource-constrained IoT devices, there are limited efforts on hardware-oriented IoT security solutions. This paper proposes a Trusted HArdware-based Scalable Secure Architecture (THASSA) for IoT Edge systems. Leveraging standard cryptographic algorithms, THASSA provides a secure mechanism for data transfer and off-loads cryptography operations to trusted hardware. The modularized THASSA architecture allows devices to be added or removed without user intervention. Also, THASSA could be scaled to multiple subsystems using multiple trusted hardware to form IoT clusters with secure data path(s) for mission-critical applications. An experimental study has verified the correctness and effectiveness of THASSA.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",37,2024

With the use of this technology, it is now possible to investigate the connections among individual cells, genes, and illnesses. For the analysis of single-cell data, clustering is frequently used. Nevertheless, biological data usually contain a large amount of noise data, and traditional clustering methods are sensitive to noise. However, acquiring higher-order spatial information from the data alone is insufficient. As a result, getting trustworthy clustering findings is challenging. We propose the Cauchy hyper-graph Laplacian non-negative matrix factorization (CHLNMF) as a unique approach to address these issues. In CHLNMF, we replace the measurement based on Euclidean distance in the conventional non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), which can lessen the influence of noise, with the Cauchy loss function (CLF). The model also incorporates the hyper-graph constraint, which takes into account the high-order link among the samples. The CHLNMF model's best solution is then discovered using a half-quadratic optimization approach. Finally, using seven scRNA-seq datasets, we contrast the CHLNMF technique with the other nine top methods.

Here, we present a novel hydrogel-based electronic skin (e-skin) capable of dual-mode sensing of temperature and strain. The thermocouple ion selected for this study is the iodine/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couple, which is a common component in everyday disinfectants. By leveraging the thermoelectric conversion in conjunction with the inherent piezoresistive effect of a gel electrolyte, self-powered sensing is achieved by utilizing the temperature difference between the human body and the external environment. The composite hydrogels synthesized from polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) monomers using a simple freeze‒thaw method exhibit remarkable flexibility, extensibility, and adaptability to human tissue. The incorporation of zwitterions further augments the resistance of the hydrogel to dehydration and low temperatures, allowing maintenance of more than 90% of its weight after 48 h in the air. Given its robust thermal current response, the hydrogel was encapsulated and then integrated onto various areas of the human body, including the cheeks, fingers, and elbows. Furthermore, the detection of the head-down state and the monitoring of foot movements demonstrate the promising application of the hydrogel in supervising the neck posture of sedentary office workers and the activity status.

Determining variations in plant functional traits at multiple biological levels and linking them to environmental variables across geographical ranges is important for forecasting range-shifts of broadly-distributed species under climate change. We sampled leaves of five deciduous Quercus spp. covering approximately 20° of latitude (~ 21° N − 41° N) and 20 longitude (~ 99° E − 119° E) across China and measured 12 plant functional traits at different biological levels. The traits varied distinctively, either within each biological level or among different levels driven by climatic and edaphic variables. Traits at the organ level were significantly correlated with those at the cellular and tissue levels, while traits at the whole-plant level only correlated with those at the tissue level. The Quercus species responded to changing environments by regulating stomatal size, leaf thickness and the palisade mesophyll thickness to leaf thickness ratios with contrasting degree of effect to adjust the whole-plant functioning, i.e., intrinsic water use efficiency (iWUE), carbon supply and nitrogen availability. The results suggest that these deciduous Quercus spp. will maintain vigour by increasing iWUE when subjected to large temperature changes and insufficient moisture, and by accumulating leaf non-structural carbohydrates under drought conditions. The findings provide new insights into the inherent variation and trait coordination of widely distributed tree species in the context of climate change.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",84,2024

Next, we report the first visual observation of such photonic Floquet–Bloch oscillations (FBOs) by employing waveguide fluorescence microscopy. Most significantly, the FBOs surpass the existing BOs in Floquet systems and exhibit exotic properties on their own, including fractal spectrum and fractional Floquet tunneling.

Evaluating model goodness of fit using the Watanabe Akaike Information Criterion (WAIC) and assessing bias through root mean square error and mean absolute error values revealed a consistent monotonic pattern. SPLTM consistently demonstrates a propensity for overestimating food security, while TMS exhibits a diverse bias profile, shifting between overestimation and underestimation based on varying correlation settings.

Methods: Eight international male race walkers (age: 28.0 years (4.4); weight: 65.6 kg (6.6); height: 180.0 cm (5.0); fat mass: 6.72% (0.66); muscle mass: 33.3 kg (3.3); VO2MAX: 66.5 ml · kg−1·min−1 (1.9)) completed this randomized crossover design clinical trial.

Methods: We developed a statistical model where the statistical epistasis was presented as an extra linkage disequilibrium between the polymorphic sites of different risk genes. The power of statistical test for identifying the gene–gene interaction was calculated and then compared in different hypothesis scenarios. Results: Our results show the statistical power increases with the increasing of interaction coefficient, relative risk, and linkage disequilibrium with genetic markers. However, the power of interaction discovery is much lower than that of regular single-site association test. When rigorous criteria were employed in statistical tests, the identification of gene–gene interaction became a very difficult task. Since the criterion of significance was given to be p-value ≤ 5.0 × 10–8, the same as that of many genome-wide association studies, there is little chance to identify the gene–gene interaction in all kind of circumstances.

This randomised controlled trial aims to assess whether robotic-assisted surgery with the open-console Versius® system can reduce surgeons’ ergonomic risks during major colorectal resections. Methods: Prospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT05262296) in March 2022. Adult patients requiring a minimally invasive colorectal resection were potentially eligible. Photographs taken at 2-min intervals were analysed using the objective Rapid Entire Body Assessment (REBA) posture analysis scale to calculate intraoperative surgeon ergonomic risk. Secondary outcomes included team communication (Oxford NOTECHS II), surgeon cognitive strain (modified NASA-TLX scale), and clinical outcomes. Results: Sixty patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio (40 robot, 20 laparoscopic). Mean age was 65yrs and 34 (57%) were male. Body Mass Index did not differ between the 2 groups (overall mean 29.0 ± 5) and there were equal proportions of left and right-colonic resections. REBA was significantly lower in the robotic arm (median robot REBA score 3 vs lap REBA 5 [p < 0.001]), equating to an injury risk category drop from “medium” to “low risk”. There were no significant differences in team communication, operative duration, or patient outcomes. Surgeon cognitive strain was lower in robotic cases (mean robot 32.4 ± 10.3 vs lap 45.6 ± 14.3 [p < 0.001]).

Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effect of bariatric surgery on key pathways in energy, and to assess the potential predictive role of body composition and metabolic parameters in this regard. Settings: Hazrat-e Rasool General Hospital, Center of Excellence of International Federation for Surgery of Obesity. Methods: This prospective cohort study was carried out on 45 patients with morbid obesity who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery. The patients have evaluated three-time points at baseline, three, and six months after the surgery. Body composition components, the levels of PGC-1α, UCP-2, and metabolic parameters were measured three times during this study. Results: Significant changes in TWL%, EBMIL%, and metabolic lab tests were observed at three- and six months post-surgery (P < 0.001). The PGC-1α and UCP-2 had a significant increase three and then six-month post-operation compared with the baseline (P < 0.001). Moreover, multivariate linear regression analysis identified that the changing trend of PGC-1α was associated with insulin, uric Acid, HOMA-IR, fat mass and trunk fat mass. UCP-2 was associated with TSH, AST, fat mass and FFM. Conclusions: Bariatric surgery has been shown to have a positive effect on UCP-2 and PGC-1α levels, as well as body composition and metabolic parameters. As a result, it is believed that bariatric surgery could improve thermogenesis and energy expenditure by enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis and function.

A randomized controlled trial,Langenbeck's Archives of Surgery,"[('Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Campus Bio-Medico', 'Rome', 'Italy'), ('Università Campus Bio-Medico di Roma', 'Rome', 'Italy')]","© The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.Background: Protective stoma after rectal surgery has been associated with important complications. The most common is surgical site infection (SSI) high rates after stoma reversal reported in literature. Our study compared the rate of SSI of two skin closure techniques, linear closure, and purse string closure. Methods: We carried out a single center, prospective, randomized controlled trial in the Department of Colorectal Surgery of Fondazione Policlinico Campus Bio-Medico of Rome between January 2018 through December 2021, to compare LC vs PS closure of ileostomy sites. Results: A total of 117 patients (53.84% male) with a mean age of 65.68 ± 14.33 years were finally evaluated in the study. 58 patients were included in the PS group and 59 patients in the LC one. There was a marked difference in the SSI rate between the two arms of the study: 3 of 58 patients in the purse-string arm versus 11 of 59 in the control arm (p = 0.043). The outcome of cosmesis was also higher in PS, with a statistical significance (mean ± DS 4,01 ± 0,73 for PS group vs mean ± DS 2,38 ± 0,72 for LC group, p < 0,001). Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that the PS technique had a significantly lower incidence of stoma site SSI compared with LC technique. Our findings are in line with other randomized studies and suggest that PS closure could be considered as standard of care for wound closure after ileostomy reversal.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",33,2024

COPD exacerbations are an important cause of morbidity and mortality, affecting cardiovascular risk, and are associated with poorer health status. The aim of this study was to assess the association between cardiovascular risk (CVR) and HRQL, according to exacerbator or non-exacerbator phenotype. We undertook a cross-sectional, observational, descriptive study of 107 patients with COPD. Patients with two or more moderate exacerbations or one severe exacerbation in the previous year were considered as exacerbators. The CVR was calculated with the Framingham scale and SCORE (Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation) and the HRQL was assessed with the generic questionnaire Short Form-36 Health Survey (SF-36), the St George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) and the COPD Assessment Test (CAT). Statistical analysis was done with SPSS version 26.0 for Windows. The SF-36 and the SGRQ showed lower values for the exacerbator phenotype, indicating a poorer quality of life. The CAT questionnaire showed values above 10 for the exacerbator phenotype, and lower values in the non-exacerbator group. After categorizing the sample according to their median age (65 years), we found a greater deterioration in HRQL in patients under 65 years of age according to the SF-36, the SGRQ and the CAT. We also detected differences in HRQL between non-exacerbator patients with a high CVR according to the Framingham (≥ 20%) and SCORE (≥ 5%) scales compared to those without this risk. A tendency towards worse HRQL was observed in non-exacerbator patients with a high CVR, which was statistically significant for the SGRQ impact domain on the SCORE scale. The CAT also showed a worse quality of life in non-exacerbator patients with a high CVR, which was significant in the Framingham model (Framingham high risk 8.41 vs non-high risk 6.05, p < 0.01). These differences were not observed in exacerbator patients. Our findings confirm that a high CVR influences HRQL in patients with COPD, especially in non-exacerbator patients with a high CVR, measured according to the SGRQ and the CAT.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",56,2024

We present the first documented case of this neoplasm arising as a lung primary tumor. Case Presentation: A 74-year-old woman with a 40-year smoking history presented with a 2.1 × 1.7 cm lung nodule discovered on computed tomography (CT) scan. A biopsy and subsequent lobe resection were performed, as well as an extensive metastatic work up, which revealed no additional masses. No specific line of differentiation was found by immunohistochemical staining, and an RNA-based fusion panel revealed a MEIS1::NCOA2 fusion, at which point a diagnosis of Low-Grade Undifferentiated Sarcoma with MEIS1::NCOA2-Rearrangement was rendered. Conclusions: This report represents the first diagnosis of this tumor primary to the lung, and provides additional insight into the origin and localization of these rare tumors.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",17,2024

Paying attention to these two factors is very important to improve the condition of children with type 1 diabetes. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of exercise on sleep habits in children with type 1 diabetes. Material & methods: 62 children with type 1 diabetes participated in this clinical trial. They will be divided into the intervention group (31) and the control group (31). Sleep habits were measured using the Children’s Sleep Habits Questionnaire (CSHQ). All children’s parents completed the CSHQ. The intervention for the experimental group consisted of 8 weeks of regular exercise program. The exercise program was prepared as an educational video and provided to parents. Paired sample t-test and ANCOVA test were used with SPSS 23. Results: 62 children with an average age of 9.32 ± 2.02 were studied. Fifty-four and eight% of the children were girls and the rest were boys. The analysis of the variance test showed a significant difference (F = 144.72, P ≤ 0.01) between the average score of the sleep habits of the control group (62.45 ± 5.12) and the experimental group (47.06 ± 4.39). Conclusion: Sleep habits in the experimental group improved after 8 weeks of exercise training using educational videos. Exercise as a non-pharmacological treatment is an effective way to manage diabetes and improve sleep quality in diabetic children.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",50,2024

All rights reserved.Michel Houellebecq’s representations of selfhood, both in his theoretical works and literary oeuvre, depict the self as unstable, decentered or fluid, evoking postmodern theory about the dissociative nature of the self. In his essay “Approaches to Distress” (1997), he posits the notion of the “mutable self,” and, for the unmoored protagonists of his novels, self-identity becomes increasingly fractured and fluid as they are engulfed by what the author terms “the market society.” Herein, the individual is enjoined to adapt and change (in consonance with market forces, consumer tastes, social trends) while fixed values and identities are swept away by the mutability of capitalism. In his representations of selfhood, Houellebecq evokes the theories of Baudrillard and Jameson concerning postmodern schizophrenia, the latter eschewing clinical definitions of the term to offer a diagnosis of the subject’s fractured psychical apparatus and loss of subjectivity in postmodernity.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",36,2024

On each of these sites, she is deeply concerned with the pervasive dichotomies of subject/object, self/other, and past/present. The fraught dichotomy between words and images forms the organizing force for how she writes and draws about all dichotomies, as she disrupts the hierarchy between word and image of Lacan’s symbolic order without, as many feminists scholars have, deeming the symbolic order of language inherently patriarchal. Drawing from Julia Kristeva’s theorizing of Lacan’s symbolic order, Hillary Chute’s comics theory, as well as W.J.T. Mitchell’s work on the relationship between word and image, I analyze each book sequentially. In her memoirs, Bechdel disrupts the very distinction between word and image. When she recreates book passages and letters, these are not simply transcriptions, but drawings of physical pages, treating words as images. Chute and DeKoven’s definition of comics focuses on it as a dual medium, but in Bechdel’s memoirs, the relationship between word and image is not as stable as duality. It is a collaboration requiring constant renegotiation.","{'month': '12', 'year': '2024', 'date-text': 'December 2024', 'day': '01'}",32,2024
